To determine additional features required for creating the new ACT2 dataset, we relied on the following two approaches: • Results from 3C shared task – The response of participating teams from both versions of the shared task gave various insights about the features that are critical for citation purpose and influence classification tasks (Maheshwari et al., 2021; Baig et al., 2021; Varanasi et al., 2021; de Andrade and Gonc¸alves, 2020; Mishra and Mishra, 2020). Table1 illustrates the features used by teams, which finished first and second. Submitted results show the use of citation context for extracting semantic information for both tasks. However, cited and citing titles were also found valuable for performance improvement. Besides, most of the participants commented on the need to include additional information about the cited paper as part of the shared task dataset. • Insights from meta-analysis – A comprehensive meta-analysis (Kunnath et al., 2021) on citation classification reveals the use of a diverse set of features by the existing methods. Table 2 shows the most frequently used attributes for both purpose and influence classification systems. There is a significant overlap of features used for both tasks. However notable difference is in the use of more contextual information from citing paper for citation purpose classification, whereas methods for influence task relies on features from cited work (e.g. abstract) as well. Similar feature preferences was also observed from the submitted results of the 3C shared task.
