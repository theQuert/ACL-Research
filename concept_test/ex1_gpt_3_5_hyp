Given the abstract and related work provided, a suitable research method for this paper could be to propose an improved citation classification model using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging pre-trained language models like SciBERT. This method would involve the following steps:\n\n1. Data collection and preprocessing: Collecting a multidisciplinary dataset, such as the ACT2 dataset, which has annotations for both citation function and importance classes. Additionally, including contextual features for cited papers, such as the abstract of the cited paper, which can potentially improve classification results. Preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality and compatibility with the model.\n\n2. Feature extraction: Utilizing the selected features used by the more successful teams in the previous shared tasks (WOSP2020 and SDP2021) for citation classification. This could involve extracting both contextual and non-contextual features from the dataset.\n\n3. Model development: Building a deep learning model, specifically leveraging pre-trained language models like SciBERT, to classify citations based on their purpose and importance. This model should take into account the selected features and be trained on the annotated dataset.\n\n4. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the proposed model by comparing it with existing models and approaches for citation classification. This could involve metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, comparing the results to those from the previous shared tasks to assess the improvement.\n\n5. Analysis of results: Analyzing the performance of the proposed model and discussing the findings. This could involve discussing the impact of supplementary data, such as the contextual features for cited papers, on the model's performance.\n\n6. Discussion of challenges: Describing the challenges encountered during the feature extraction and model development process. This could include discussing any limitations or difficulties in procuring annotated datasets for citation classification.\n\nBy following this research method, the paper can contribute to the field by proposing an improved citation classification model that considers both the purpose and importance of citations. The inclusion of additional contextual features and the use of deep learning techniques can potentially enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of citation classification systems.
