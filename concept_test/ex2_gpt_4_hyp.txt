'### RESEARCH METHOD:\n\nGiven the focus of the study on investigating the efficiency of various regularization and fine-tuning methods to mitigate the loss of generality in foundation models, the following research method can be considered:\n\n1. **Model Selection and Pre-training**: This study uses existing foundation models such as CLIP for Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Galactica for Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are pre-trained typically on vast datasets to endow them with a level of generality. \n\n2. **Design and Setup of Experiments**: Design experiments to measure the loss of generality after these models undergo fine-tuning. For instance, for CLIP, fine-tune it on the ImageNet dataset and subsequently test its distribution generality on the ImageNet variants. Similarly, another experiment could be conducted on Galactica by fine-tuning it in the medical domain and assessing its capability in following instructions and common sense.\n\n3. **Fine-tuning and Regularization**: Apply various regularization methods from continual learning, the weight averaging method (Wise-FT) from out-of-distributional (OOD) generalization, which interpolates parameters between pre-trained and fine-tuned models, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the pre and post fine-tuned models. \n\n4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in mitigating the loss of generality and in balancing speciality and generality. Measure the performance using suitable metrics. \n\n5. **Repeated Validation**: Reinforce finding by repeating these experiments with different stimuli to ensure robustness and validity of the results. \n\n6. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the results achieved from different methods to highlight which method was able to improve the balance between generality and speciality of the foundation models.\n\n7. **Documentation and Reporting of Findings**: Record all results, observations and findings. Discuss these results in the context of existing literature and research to support any new implications or understandings generated by the study.\n\nThis method will allow researchers to understand how the balance between speciality and generality can be controlled and improved in foundation models like VLMs and LLMs.\n'
