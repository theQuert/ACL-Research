'### RESEARCH METHOD:\n\nThe research method for this study is based on data collection, data augmentation and feature engineering, followed by machine learning modelling. The approach can be detailed as follows:\n\n1. **Dataset Selection:** The base dataset for this study will be the SDP 3C shared task dataset, ACT-SDP, which contains annotations about citation classification.\n\n2. **Data Augmentation:** The dataset is expanded by adding new auxiliary features. These features are selected based on the analysis of features that proved beneficial in prior shared tasks, thus understanding which features are more promising for citation classification.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering:** Further, the data is enriched with supplementary contextual and non-contextual features sets, which includes contextual features for cited papers such as the abstract of the cited paper. The feature extraction process will need to be carefully managed given the complexity and potential difficulties in data sourcing.\n\n4. **Machine Learning Model Selection and Training:** The methodology will likely involve training a deep learning model (as suggested by the success of SciBERT) on the enhanced dataset. The models will be evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying the citation purpose and influence.\n\n5. **Evaluation and Benchmarking:** The model outputs will be compared against existing methods used for citation classification, leveraging the benchmarking information available from the first citation context classification (3C) shared task. This ensures that the proposed model is effective and offers improvements over existing methods.\n\nThis method follows a general empirical approach to research in computer science and data science, where the hypothesis is tested through experimental design, data collection, and statistical analysis.'
