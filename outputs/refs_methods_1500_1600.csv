This approach is confounded by the observation that driver mutations target multiple cellular signaling and regulatory pathways."

To this purpose, we studied multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from two broad groups (all participants were females): artists (professionally trained in visual arts) and non-artists (without any training in art)."
17,"We sought to link well established measures of divergent thinking and creative achievement (Creative Achievement Questionnaire - CAQ) to cortical thickness in a cohort of young (23.7 +- 4.2 years), healthy subjects. This is the first study to link cortical thickness measures to psychometric measures of creativity."

56,This paper reviews the properties and applications of certain n-ary generalizations of Lie algebras in a self-contained and unified way.
57,"In Reconstructing the Cognitive World, Michael Wheeler argues that we should turn away from the generically Cartesian philosophical foundations of much contemporary cognitive science research and proposes instead a Heideggerian approach. He points to recent research in ""embodied-embedded"" cognitive science and proposes a Heideggerian framework to identify, amplify, and clarify the underlying philosophical foundations of this new work. He focuses much of his investigation on recent work in artificial intelligence-oriented robotics, discussing, among other topics, the nature and status of representational explanation, and whether (and to what extent) cognition is computation rather than a noncomputational phenomenon best described in the language of dynamical systems theory."
58,"Some of these historical affinities, and some of the relations between faculty psychology and Cartesianism, are discussed in the book."
59,This revolutionary book provides fresh answers to long-standing questions of human origins and consciousness. Informing these insights is a new understanding of how Darwinian processes underlie the brain's development and function as well as its evolution. It injects a renewed sense of adventure into the experience of being human.
60,"She intended it for people whose work includes being active readers, and for them it does represent a useful work of synthesis."
61,"Introduction One of the tasks facing cognitive archaeology is to contribute towards an understanding of the nature and evolution of the human mind. We need to make explicit reference to past cognition when interpreting the archaeological record and to draw inferences from that data concerning ancient minds . In this paper I focus on one of these debates, that concerning whether the mind is a general purpose learning mechanism or composed of a series of relatively independent mental modules - psychological mechanisms dedicated to specific tasks or behavioural domains. My review of this debate suggests that a major feature of human cognitive evolution has been increased accessibility between mental modules resulting in a generalized intelligence, though one remaining within a modular architecture."

71,The contribution made by Clark's work is to show the range of ways in which cognition exploits bodily and environmental resources.
72,We support this thought and also propose that utilizing that the world is rich on information is essential. We develop this idea to show how attention and figure-ground segmentation by an active observer using multiple cues can be separated from analyzing and recognizing what is seen in a consistent way.

75,We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN).

This theory enables  researchers to test a specific numerical hypothesis  about the population alpha and to obtain confidence  intervals for the population coefficient."
88,"This paper reviews four major topics related to the long-term psychosocial rehabilitation for burn survivors; (1) Body image adjustment process; (2) Social functioning challenges; (3) Interventions designed to address psychosocial rehabilitation challenges; and (4) Current policy developments in the USA and the UK that focus on raising the rehabilitation standards for psychosocial care for burn survivors. While acknowledging the close relationship between body image distress and social functioning, these two areas are reviewed separately with the goal of addressing two specific questions."

92,"The nature of these effects as well as potential effects due to ""gross errors"" in the data set should be investigated in order to determine which observations, if any, need to be analyzed separately or excluded entirely. The purpose of this paper is (1) to propose a new technique for identifying influential observations and observations containing ""gross errors"" and (2) to discuss situations under which each is likely to significantly alter the results of a factor analysis.factor analysis, influential observations"
