15,"Part I raises the problems that will shape our investigation of representation. The theme of Chapters 4 to 6 is that a signifier  is only as good as the intelligence which uses it. Part III focuses on the activity of representation. In Chapter 7 a distinction is made between active and passive senses of representation, and arising  out of this distinction we study the particular case of images, considered as a form of representation."

32,OBJECTIVE To examine whether sgACC activity is a reliable and robust prognostic outcome marker of CT for depression and whether sgACC activity changes in treatment.

35,"A central goal in neuroscience is to interpret neural activation and, moreover, to do so in a way that captures universal principles by generalizing across individuals. Here, we present a novel and highly accurate solution to this problem, which decodes across subjects between eight different stimulus conditions. The key to finding this solution was questioning the seemingly obvious idea that neural decoding should work directly on neural activation patterns."
36,This systematic review aims to investigate neurobiological changes related to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in anxiety disorders detected through neuroimaging techniques and to identify predictors of response to treatment.
37,"A common goal of neuroimaging research is to use imaging data to identify the mental processes that are engaged when a subject performs a mental task. In this Perspective, I outline the critique of informal reverse inference and describe a number of new developments that provide the ability to more formally test the predictive power of neuroimaging data"
38,"The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, which constitutes the first neuroimaging investigation of the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) using an emotional activation paradigm, was to probe the effects of CBT on the neural correlates of spider phobia."

40,&amp; The ability to cognitively regulate emotional responses to aversive events is important for mental and physical health.

43,AIMS To determine whether there are concomitant brain activation changes as a result of engaging in cognitive remediation therapy (CRT).
44,In attempting to understand the functional substrates of mood we attempted to identify brain regions associated with the cognitive generation of affect in bipolar depressed patients.
45,"This paper reviews functional neuroimaging studies on psychotherapy effects and their methodological background, including the development of symptom provocation techniques."
46,This study sought to identify brain regions that underlie symptom changes in severely affected IBS patients undergoing cognitive therapy (CT).

48,"In this paper, these difficulties are discussed, and strategies and procedures for overcoming them are described."
49,"In this article, the assertion that different psychological therapies are of broadly similar efficacy-often called the 'Dodo Bird Verdict'-is contrasted with the alternative view that there are specific therapies that are more effective than others for particular diagnoses."

51,"The main hypothesis guiding this work is that the carpool formation and use process is sensitive to personal and household characteristics, space, time, travel cost, and workplace TDM policies."
52,This paper summarizes the literature on the effectiveness of employee ridesharing programs.

54,
55,"This paper examines employee's perceptions of their modal choice during the journey to work, and addresses what factors influence modal choice, and whether people can be moved out of their cars to other more sustainable forms of transport."

58,"Such plans seek to reduce trips to work by car by providing, through individual employers, a targeted, integrated package of incentives and disincentives to influence commuters' choice of mode for travel to and from the workplace. This paper makes a critical assessment of the potential of ETPs to reduce trips by car to and from workplaces."
59,
60,"This paper studies the potential of carpooling among unrelated partners (i.e., inter-household carpooling) for demand reduction during peak commute hours. This paper focuses on a simplified urban sprawl in which the densities of workers and jobs are uniform over an infinitely large flat geographical area."
61,
62,"This paper gives a detailed empirical analysis of the relationships between different indicators of costs of commuting trips by car: difference as the crow flies, shortest travel time according to route planner, corresponding travel distance, and reported travel time."
63,
64,"This paper provides an initial discussion of carpooling in China by exploring a series of questions. Acknowledging the social benefits of voluntary carpooling, this paper argues: (1) bus lanes may be a better choice than HOV lanes when converting general motor vehicle lanes; (2) policies subsidizing carpoolers cannot be justified on either efficiency or equity grounds because a marginal carpooler is more likely transitioning from a transit user or non-motorized traveler than from a driver."

67,"This paper, focused primarily on UK data and debates, considers the potential significance of travel time use within past, present and future patterns of mobility."
68,
69,"This paper reviews the evidence that travel plans have their intended effect, which is to reduce the number of employees commuting alone by car to their place of work. It then seeks to explain how take up and hence the effect of travel plans could be made more widespread."
70,"Using key-variables from these theories, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model for travel behaviour."
71,"Expanding the analysis to also include both objective and subjective characteristics at other model levels (i.e., not only stage of life characteristics but also personal lifestyles; not only car availability but also travel attitudes, not only modal choice but also mode specific attitudes) is the purpose of this paper."
72,
73,"Besides environmental objectives, employment concerns motivate governments to invest in railways."
74,"Abstract This paper discusses the usefulness of the trend towards microsimulation in urban transport and land-use modelling for the planning practice. As a possible solution to the macro-micro debate, it calls for a theory of multi-level models according to which for each planning task there is an appropriate level of conceptual, spatial and temporal resolution."

77,The aim of this paper is to analyse the degree to which Park and Ride is effective in the contemporary policy context.
78,"The goal of this paper is to assess the role of density in affecting mode choice decisions in home-based work tours, while controlling for confounding factors. The study advances the field by analyzing the role of the built environment on home-based work tours."
79,"This book reviews the challenges that face industrialized societies as they cope with growing dependence on transport fueled by low-priced oil. The book begins with an exploration of past transport revolutions, to gain insight into the nature and dynamics of profound change. Topics include current transport, with a focus on energy use and adverse impacts; the politics and business of transport; and organizational and technical innovations that could ensure effective, secure movement of people and goods in ways that minimize environmental impacts and make the best use of renewable sources of energy."

81,"For studying carpooling problems, this paper presents two models, namely deterministic and stochastic, and gives the economic explanations to the model solutions. We investigate the jockeying behavior of work commuters between carpooling and driving alone modes through solving each model for both no-toll equilibrium and social optimum."
82,"Accordingly, this study examines two research questions."
83,"The purpose of this article is to clarify the approach taken in the study, the types of evidence reviewed and the overall conclusions reached."

89,Abstract In this study we measure change in total factor productivity for production of Atlantic salmon in Norway from 2001 to 2008. This is due to a regress in the technical change component of the MPI.
90,
91,"In this article, we estimate a restricted profit function for Norwegian salmon producers, which allows us to examine the industry's short-run and long-run supply responsiveness separately."
92,
93,"I argue that the rise in food prices over 2007 and the first half of 2008 should be seen as part of the wider commodity boom which is largely the result of rapid economic growth in China and throughout Asia in a context of loose money and in which, because of previous low investment, supply was inelastic."
94,This report examines economic and policy issues related to wild and farmed salmon in North America.
