19,"Here we review how Mtb, HIV, Leishmania sp., and other pathogens manipulate costimulatory molecules to establish chronic infection. This review summarizes the convergent devices that pathogens employ to tune and tame the immune system using costimulatory molecules. Studying host-pathogen interaction in context with costimulatory signals may unveil the molecular mechanism that will help in understanding the survival/death of the pathogens."

49,In this article I intend to describe an issue of the Dutch euthanasia practice that is not common knowledge. This article does not focus on the arguments for or against euthanasia and the ethical justification of physician-assisted dying.
50,"The main aim of this paper is to compare the association of family structure with outcomes for young people in living in the West of Scotland (the Twenty-07 Study, N=1009) with their contemporaries living in Britain (the 1970 British Cohort Study N=11615) in the mid-1980s."

52,Abstract Objective To assess how euthanasia in terminally ill cancer patients affects the grief response of bereaved family and friends.
53,"This study examines which end-of-life decisions (ELDs) Belgian physicians label 'euthanasia', which ELDs they think should be reported and the physician characteristics associated with correct labelling of euthanasia cases, the awareness that they should be reported and the reporting of them."
54,BACKGROUND The aims of this study were to obtain information about the characteristics of requests for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and to distinguish among different types of situations that can arise between the request and the physician's decision.

58,"Here, we examine the potential implications of early twenty-first century climate change scenarios for the cultivation of potato, maize, wheat, barley and broad bean, five annual crops that account for 50 % of the cultivated area in the Department of Cusco and  Apuri'mac and provide the dietary backbone for a large share of the local population."
59,Objective To obtain in-depth information about the views of patients and physicians on suffering in patients who requested euthanasia in whom the request was not granted or granted but not performed.
60,"Given the persistence of significant undernourishment despite regional development efforts, we propose a cluster approach to evaluate smallholders' vulnerability to weather extremes with regard to food security."
61,"Purpose: In the legal performance of the euthanasia procedure, unbearable suffering, one of the requirements of due care, is difficult to assess."
62,"This paper assesses the contribution of advance directives to decision-making in the care of people with dementia, with a special focus on non-treatment directives and directives for euthanasia."

65,"The objective of the Task Force is to assess the degree of palliative care development in the European Region as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Task Force is a collaboration between EAPC, the International Observatory on End of Life Care, Help the Hospices and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care. The work of the Task Force covers the entire WHO European Region of 52 countries. In this article we present a comparative study on the development of palliative care in Europe, drawing on all four elements of the study."
66,Aims: To Study the religious and ideological views and practice of Palliative Care physician towards Euthanasia.
67,The book strives for as complete and dispassionate a description of the situation as possible.
68,Previous research tends toward basic designs reporting on attitudes in the context of just one or two potentially influencing factors; we aimed to test the comparative importance of a larger range of variables in a sample of nursing trainees and non-nursing controls.

76,Respect for patient autonomy requires physicians to involve their patients in this decision making.The objective of this study was to examine the involvement of advanced lung cancer patients and their families in ELD making and compare their actual involvement with their previously stated preferences for involvement.Patients with Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer were recruited by physicians in 13 hospitals and regularly interviewed between diagnosis and death.

79,In this context initiatives were taken in the Netherlands and Belgium to establish specialized services providing such consultants: Support and Consultation for Euthanasia in the Netherlands (SCEN) and Life End Information Forum (LEIF) in Belgium. The aim of this study is to describe and compare these initiatives.We studied and compared relevant documents concerning the Dutch and Belgian consultation service (e.g.

88,Objectives: To study physicians' experiences and attitudes concerning the choice between euthanasia and PAS.
89,"However, our understanding of such influences remains piecemeal given the limited number of empirical analyses on this subject, the paucity of comparative works, and the limited consideration of political and institutional theory in these studies.This review highlights the need for a more explicit engagement with the political and institutional factors affecting the use of health evidence in decision-making."
