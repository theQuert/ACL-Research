2,"Integrated records of the co-evolving human-environment system over millennia are needed to provide a basis for a deeper understanding of the present and for forecasting the future. This requires the major task of assembling and integrating regional and global historical, archaeological, and paleoenvironmental records."
3,"In this paper, we bring together and re-evaluate paleoenvironmental, ethnobiological, and archaeological data to reconstruct the related effects of climatic shifts and human adaptations to and alterations of the lowland Maya Forest. We propose that the succeeding period of climatic chaos during the Preclassic period, 4,000-1,750 years ago, provoked the adaptation to settled agrarian life."

11,"In this paper we shall investigate fragments of Kripke--Platek set  theory with Infinity which arise from the full theory by restricting  Foundation to \Pi n Foundation, where n  2."
12,"This paper, though, is concerned with a rather different interpretation."
13,"The main objective of this paper is to show that a certain formulae-asclasses interpretation based on generalized set recursive functions provides a selfvalidating semantics for Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory, CZF."

18,"Understanding the population dynamic balance between the organisms of the phyllosphere as an ecological system should lead to new approaches in agronomy, crop protection and breeding that enhance sustainability, where the previously presumed requirement to eliminate putative pathogens is replaced by management that favours dominance of beneficial organisms and contains putative pathogens in asymptomatic or stable states."

22,This paper presents the negative impact of seed borne fungi and their implication in food safety.
23,This action research aims to investigate how technology improves the conditions of storytelling to help enhance the learning attitude and motivation of EFL children with learning difficulty using power point designs and an online recording system--VoiceThread (http://voicethread.com/). The use of power point designs is to assure children of clear illustrations and print during storytelling.
24,This study examines whether teachers' self-perceived knowledge about oral English teaching differs with regard to their professional profiles in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context in China.

31,"The purpose of this paper is to report on the nature of collaboration in a multi-year, large-scale collaborative action research project in which a teachers' federation (in Ontario, Canada), university researchers and teachers partnered to investigate teacher-selected topics for inquiry."
32,This study addressed 1525 Jordanian EFL school learners' attitudes and perceived implementation of traditional form-focused (FFI) instruction and communicative meaning-oriented instruction (MOI) of English.
33,"This paper evaluates two methods to evolve neural networks architectures, one carried out with genetic algorithm and a second one carry out with differential evolution algorithm. The object of this study is to try to improve the final forecasting getting an accurate system.The research reported here has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under project TRA2007-67374-C02-02"
34,The goal is to help users to easily apply SVM to their applications.

40,"In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to extract time series features based on time series imaging."
41,"In the words of the authors, the goal of this book was to ""bring together many of the important new ideas in learning, and explain them in a statistical framework."" The aim is to discover types of products often purchased together. A strength of the book is the attempt to organize a plethora of methods into a coherent whole."

61,The purpose of this article is to describe mediating variables and moderating variables and provide reasons for integrating them in outcome studies. The primary focus is on mediating and moderating variables for intervention research but many issues apply to nonintervention research as well.

71,"This paper contributes to the economics of financial institutions risk management by exploring how loan securitization a.ects their default risk, their systematic risk, and their stock prices."
72,"Their purpose was partly to present results from an ongoing joint research project and partly to stimulate some interaction of discussion of banking regulation between academics, bankers, and regulators (in alphabetical order)."
73,The most important change is a shift in governance from state to the market. These challenges - put in a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective - are the subject of the book.
74,I investigate the effect of wealth on consumption in a new dataset with financial and housing wealth from 16 countries.
75,
76,This paper develops a theory of financial intermediation based on minimizing the cost of monitoring information which is useful for resolving incentive problems between borrowers and lenders. The paper presents some more general analysis of the effect of diversification on resolving incentive problems.
77,
78,
79,This paper examines the allocation of credit in a market in which borrowers have greater information concerning their own riskiness than do lenders.

81,"In this article, we consider the debate regarding the future of hedge fund regulation, building the case that regulatory reform to constrain excessive leverage must be applied in equal measure to all financial market participants, not just hedge funds. The challenge for regulators is to carefully craft a regime of transparency and disclosure which minimises the potential for systemic risk without jeopardising the financial innovation and entrepreneurship that is emblematic of the hedge fund sector.Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsFull Tex"

90,"In four essays, Chomsky attempts to situate linguistic theory in the broader cognitive sciences, with the essays formulating and progressively developing the minimalist approach to linguistic theory. With this book, Chomsky built on pursuits from the earliest days of generative grammar to formulate a new research program that had far-reaching implications for the field."
