5,"This paper gives a summary of the syntax and interpretation rules of the proposed international algebraic language put forward by the Zurich ACM-GAMM Conference, followed by a formal , complete presentation of the same information. The proposed language is intended to provide convenient and concise means for expressing virtually all procedures of numerical computation while employing relatively few syntactical rules and types of statement."
6,"The goal of a linguist is to discover grammars that are simple and yet are able to fully span the language. This paper briefly present these three grammars and summarizes Chomsky's analysis and results which state that finite-state grammars are inadequate because they fail to span all possible sentences of the English language, and phrase structure grammar is overly complex."

21,"Our aim was to develop a social model of genre that generalized across these and other text types (Christie & Martin, 1997; Eggins & Martin, 1997; Martin, 1985/ 1989, 1992; Ventola, 1987), and we appreciated having L&W's work to draw on. One strand was community based and oriented to mapping the repertoire of genres through which people enact their lives. The other strand was school based (Rothery, 1990) and concerned with mapping the repertoire of genres used by students to succeed in school and to redrstribute control of these to students who were not accessing them (Hasan & Williams, 1985/1996; Martin, 1993). Here we were concerned with deconstructing the kinds of narrative students were expected to write and critique (Rothery & Macken, l99l)."

In this article, I offer support for Hansen's overall position that humanism has provided a foundational framework for the present and future of professional counseling."

38,Purpose - This article aims to explore the geographic distribution of open access practices in the world from a diffusionist perspective.Design/methodology/approach - The article applies a tempo-spatial analysis to examine the diffusion movement of open access practices from the West to the entire world during the past several decades.
39,In this paper we present the design and performance evaluation of a brokering service that supports at runtime the self-adaptation of composite services offered to several concurrent users with different service levels.
40,Demonstrating this phenonemon is hampered by the difficulty of isolating the effects of time since population divergence vs. gene flow on levels of molecular genetic differentiation.

49,"This study analyzes data on patients transferred from their initial modality at the University Hospital Gent between 1978 and 1996 for the reasons for, and outcomes from, the transfer. This is due to the differences in the reasons for transfer, which are PD-related complications in the case of PD patients, and cardiovascular problems in the case of HD patients."

52,This prospective study sought to identify the potential reversibility of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXAIPN) by following-up its long-term course 2 years after discontinuation of oxaliplatin (OXA)-based chemotherapy.
53,The improvement in survival for patients with early-stage colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin has highlighted the need for valid and reliable assessment of peripheral neuropathy.The objective of this paper was to explore neuropathic symptoms in oxaliplatin-treated patients as assessed using different methods.Consecutive symptomatic patients reporting peripheral neuropathy after oxaliplatin chemotherapy for colorectal cancer were interviewed using a semi-structured clinical interview.

55,The goal of Web search personalization is to tailor search results to a particular user based on that user's interests and preferences. We present an approach to personalized search that involves building models of user context as ontological profiles by assigning implicitly derived interest scores to existing concepts in a domain ontology.

57,"In order to make sense of and explore this large-scale body of knowledge we need an accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date ontology of research topics. In this paper we present Klink-2, a novel approach which improves on our earlier work on automatic generation of semantic topic networks and addresses the aforementioned limitations by taking advantage of a variety of knowledge sources available on the web."

61,"The recommendations are intended to provide interesting elements to users. This paper proposes a recommender system in the leisure domain, specifically in the movie showtimes domain. In detail, a domain ontology primarily serving a semantic similarity metric adjusted to the concept of ""packages of single items"" was developed in this research."
62,"This paper is presenting a generic ontology-based user modeling architecture, (OntobUM), applied in the context of a Knowledge Management System (KMS)."
63,We propose new metrics for computing semantic similarity of user profiles using spreading activation networks derived from ontologies.

75,"Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www.galanoe.eu) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG."
