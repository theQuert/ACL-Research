55,The aim of this study was to assess OHRQOL outcomes in orthodontics while controlling for individual psychological characteristics.
56,OBJECTIVES The first objective was to assess whether having had orthodontic treatment affected the levels of oral health-related quality of life impacts in Brazilian adolescents. A second objective was to assess the relationship between a normative clinical measure of orthodontic treatment need and two measures of oral health-related quality of life.
57,The purpose of this study was to determine whether the social attractiveness of a child would be influenced by his or her dentofacial appearance.
58,
59,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between psychosocial factors and oral health status, health perceptions, and quality of life. These factors are important in understanding how oral health affects young people's daily lives."
60,This cluster-randomized trial aimed to test the effect of an intervention to enhance SOC on OHRQoL in children.
61,"The purpose of this study was to validate the child perception questionnaire (CPQ(11-14)) with a sample of schoolchildren in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom.We made a longitudinal survey of children from 1999 to 2002, using the index of orthodontic treatment need (IOTN) at baseline when the children were 11 to 12 years old, the CPQ(11-14), and their uptake of orthodontic treatment 3 years later.CPQ(11-14) scores corresponded to differences in IOTN scores."
62,"The aim of this study was to assess the association between different anterior occlusal traits and the presence of condition-specific sociodental impacts on the quality of life attributed to malocclusion. This study, designed to overcome the limitations found in the existing literature, supports the idea that malocclusion can affect social interaction and psychosocial wellbeing."
63,
64,The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of condition-specific impacts on daily performances attributed to malocclusion in British adolescents.
65,"The aim of the present study was to determine the biopsychosocial impact of malocclusion on the daily living of Brazilian adolescents (14 to 18 years of age) through normative and subjective records and identify factors directly involved in the self-perception of malocclusions.Cross-sectional.Public and private schools in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil.The sample was made up of 403 adolescents, with no prior history of orthodontic treatment, who were selected randomly from a population of 182,291 students in the same age range."
66,"The objective of this study was to examine, using structural equation modelling, the relationships among clinical characteristics (such as caries experience and malocclusion), oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), and psychological characteristics (mental health, self-esteem, somatisation, and social perception of body image) in adolescents in New Zealand."
67,
68,
69,"This paper identifies the what, why, and how of OHRQoL and presents an oral health theoretical model. The relevance of OHRQoL for dental practitioners and patients in community-based dental practices is presented."
70,OBJECTIVES To determine whether malocclusion is associated with oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in New Zealand adolescents.

72,The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) will produce a state-of-the- art multimodel dataset designed to advance our knowledge of climate variability and climate change.
73,
74,Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.
75,
76,"This urgency stems from concerns that progress made against Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) could be threatened by anthropogenic climate change beyond 2015. Although the focus of the review is on information provision and uptake in developing regions, it is clear that many developed countries are facing the same challenges."
77,The objective of this paper is to describe patterns of weight change in the six sites of the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) and explore variables that explain variation in weight change within and between sites.

82,"This paper investigates whether there is a link between cognitive ability, risk aversion, and impatience, using a representative sample of the population and incentive compatible measures."
83,"The argument is that, as rethoric, accounting must be understood as an attempt to convince some audience of the legitimacy of business ventures."
84,This paper introduces urban land teleconnections as a conceptual framework that explicitly links land changes to underlying urbanization dynamics.
85,"These case studies focus on four themes: habitat transformation and animal extinctions, agricultural practices, urban growth, and the forces that accompany complex society."
86,"We propose that incentives should be created to widen the current biodiversity management paradigm, and actively engage local stewardship associations in adaptive co-management processes of the park and surrounding green spaces."
87,This special issue of the Journal of Ethnobiology takes a close look at the region and brings into focus the intricacies that must be considered in the explanations of the rise and fall of the Maya as well as the conservation of the Maya forest today.
88,"In this chapter, the authors emphasize that the ability of a city to survive under stress has its fundamental origins in how the city was organized and maintained. Special focus is put on the organizational and ecosystem services aspects of urban agriculture in the city."

96,"The book specifies workable solutions for serving huge population lying at the bottom of the world's economic pyramid. The concept of 'Bottom of the Pyramid"" is explained in this book. The author opines that, to effectively serve this BOP market, instead of old and tried solutions, continuous innovation and a paradigm shift in the thinking process of the private sector is needed."

98,"This review discusses the characteristics of contemporary urbanization and the roles of urban planning, governance, agglomeration, and globalization forces in driving and shaping the relationship between urbanization and the environment."
99,"This article examines the role played by urban gardens during historical collapses in urban food supply lines and identifies the social processes required to protect two crit- ical elements of urban food production during times of crisis--open green spaces and the collective memory of how to grow food. These factors combine to heighten the potential for food shortages when--as occurred in the 20th century-- major economic, political or environmental crises sever supply lines to urban areas. This paper considers how to govern urban areas sustainably in order to ensure food security in times of crisis by: evincing the effectiveness of urban gardening during crises; showing how allotment gardens serve as conduits for transmitting collective social-ecological memories of food production; and, discussing roles and strategies of urban environmental movements for protecting urban green space."
