22,"This chapter focuses on a broad class of these conscious contents. This chapter brings together ideas and data regarding ways to observe thought, the dimensions and forms of thought, and the factors that determine the content of thought as it changes from one moment to the next."
23,Consideration of both possibilities is required to resolve this ambiguity
24,
25,
26,The present study aimed at clarifying this issue by investigating the neural correlates of the various kinds of conscious experiences that can occur during task performance.

43,"The current paper proposes that such thought is produced through cooperation between autobiographical information provided by the default mode network and a frontal-parietal control network which helps sustain and buffer internal trains of thought against disruption by the external world. This paper offers a hypothesis that should help to constrain and guide interpretations, investigations, and analyses of the neural processes involved in internally driven cognition."
44,"This investigation inquires whether a similar relationship occurs when arousal is measured electrodermally, and whether nonspecific (spontaneous) electrodermal activity is associated with self-generated thoughts about current concerns."

49,"To provide insight into these questions, this article synthesizes recent literature from structural and functional imaging with a growing behavioral literature on mind wandering."
50,"Purpose: This research aims to identify whether subsequent consciousness of having been in a flow state - that is, flow consciousness - regarding an earlier impulse purchase affects consumers' post-purchase behaviours, specifically their feelings of consumer regret."

56,This study examined the effect of mood states on mind wandering.
57,"In their comment, McVay and Kane (2010) suggested that failures in executive control can create the conditions that favor mind wandering--a control-failure hypothesis that questions whether mind wandering consumes resources."
58,"ABSTRACT This dissertation argues that Bella Swan is a representation of Barbara Creed\u27s monstrous-feminine which serves to reinforce ideologies that insist women are abject, inherently dangerous to men, and threatening to a patriarchal status quo."

60,This study suggests that infants at 9 months anticipate goals and use similar cognitive mechanisms to adults in this task.

69,This study investigates the extent to which this effect of emotion on recall varies as a function of cognitively controllable inference processes and examines the relation of the effects of emotion to those of imaginability and concern-relatedness.
70,"The aims of the research were to (a) compare the alcohol attentional bias (AAB) of social, hazardous, and harmful drinkers and (b) assess the effects of alcohol attention-control training on the AAB and alcohol consumption of hazardous and harmful drinkers."

75,This article examines 2 of the most fundamental properties of affective experience--valence and arousal--asking how they are related to each other on a moment to moment basis.
76,
77,"In this article, we adopt an individual-differences perspective in considering unwanted mind wandering as an indicator of both momentary failures of and enduring deficiencies in executive-control functions."
78,"The experiences of 90 individuals who self-identify as ""excessive"" or ""maladaptive"" fantasizers are summarized in this report."

85,This paper warns against the risk of underestimating the costs--and the uncertainty about the costs--of achieving stringent stabilization targets.
86,This paper provides an overview of the AMPERE modeling comparison project with focus on the implications of near-term policies for the costs and attainability of long-term climate objectives. Nine modeling teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements to 2030.
87,"This talk focuses on three key energy sustainability objectives: energy security improvement, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of air pollution and its human health impacts."

91,This study examines the relationship between psychosocial and study skill factors (PSFs) and college outcomes by meta-analyzing 109 studies.
92,The study investigated the association and relative influence of cognitive/motivational and demographic factors on final degree grade point average (GPA) in a single undergraduate cohort.

96,The purpose of this review is to document the directions and recent progress in our understanding of the motivational dynamics of school achievement.

99,"Dweck argues that this approach has important implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes. She presents a compelling proposal for explaining motivational influences on gender differences in mathematics achievement and observes that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies.--The Editors Most research on effective learning and performance of cognitive tasks analyzes the particular cognitive skills required to succeed at those tasks. In contrast, the focus here is on motivational processes that affect success on cognitive tasks. That is, the focus is on psychological factors, other than ability, that determine how effectively the individual acquires and uses skills. The present article will focus on achievement goals and their allied behavior patterns."
