6,"I argue in this article that the concept of risk-centered governance is the best theoretical paradigm for understanding health law and the health care system. Rather than focus on doctrinal strands, I argue that scholars should analyze the law of health care as a set of governance practices organized around managing and allocating financial, as well as clinical, risk. The article builds on the egalitarian potential of social insurance as a technology of governance, and argues for filling a gap that exists not only in the current system, but also in all proposals for reform"
7,One of the key goals of political economy is to understand how institutional arrangements shape policy outcomes. This paper studies a comparatively neglected aspect of this - the forces that shape heterogeneous performance of autocracies. The paper looks empirically at spells of autocracy to establish cases where it has been successful according to various objective criteria.
8,We extend this research to examine performance implications of competitive positioning not just among but also within groups.
9,"The study here examines how business actors adapt to changes in networks by analyzing their perceptions or their network pictures. This study analyzes changes in networks in terms of the industrial network approach. This approach sees networks as connected relationships between actors, where interdependent companies interact based on their sensemaking of their relevant network environment. Another major contribution of the study is the analysis of the role that network pictures play in actors' efforts to change their network position. The study develops seven propositions in an attempt to describe the role of network pictures in network change."

The question is whether this can be translated into a research device, so that researchers may see in a structured and analytical way what an actor's picture is. The relevance of actors' views to obtain a clearer understanding of organisational networks is highlighted when the relation that is believed to exist between those views and action in organisational networks is addressed. With the aim of developing Network Pictures as research tool a two-stage method is put forward and carried out."

Our goal is to help players and network providers to estimate the amount of traffic caused by the game and the impact on access links or provider networks. We focus on the following characteristics: bandwidth, packet rate and distribution of packet inter-arrival times and packet lengths."

62,"This book deals with decision modelling techniques that can be used to estimate the value for money of various interventions including medical devices, surgical procedures, diagnostic technologies, and pharmaceuticals. This book will help analysts understand the contribution of decision-analytic modelling to the evaluation of health care programmes. This series is aimed at health economists in academia, the pharmaceutical industry and the health sector, those on advanced health economics courses, and health researchers in associated fields."

70,"Therefore, this study focused on a crucial e-government service, the Taiwan taxation service, to determine whether, in the current era in which people depend highly on network tools to send and receive information, online services are suitable for taxpayers and how to improve the service process. The taxation authority should integrate all online taxation services to achieve the expected public service (one-stop e-government window). This research facilitates relevant government agencies to provide effective e-government services, identify problems, and modify service delivery processes"

90,"This study is based on the belief that economic organization is shaped by transaction cost economizing decisions. This approach is based on behavioral assumptions of bounded rationalism and opportunism, which reflect actual human nature. These assumptions underlie the problem of economic organization: to create contract and governance structures that economize on bounded rationality while safeguarding transactions against the hazards of opportunism."

In this paper, we focus on the power bases associated with the local business network in which the different subsidiaries are embedded, and on the headquarters' knowledge concerning these networks."
