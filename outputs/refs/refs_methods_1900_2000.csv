4,"Purpose - Drawing on resource-advantage theory and a diverse literature base, this article seeks to further the development of the explanatory foundations of relationship marketing theory by proposing, and then providing, tentative answers to three ""why?"""
5,"The hypothesis explored in this paper is that this hierarchy is related to the conceptual accessi-bility of the intended referents of noun phrases that commonly occur in particu-lar relational roles, with relations higher in the hierarchy typically occupied by noun phrases representing more accessible concepts. In this paper we examine one aspect of this mapping process, arguing that an important factor in the assignment of conceptual elements to syntactic roles in the pro-duction of sentences is the ease of representing potential referents in thought, or their conceptual accessibility."

57,"Here we introduce the term ""tipping element"" to describe large-scale components of the Earth system that may pass a tipping point."

59,This paper asks how much we might be misled by our economic assessment of climate change when we employ a conventional quadratic damages function and/or a thin-tailed probability distribution for extreme temperatures.
60,
61,"This paper presents a novel approach, in which several different impacts of climate change are first assessed by means of a full-fledged computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, then results are interpolated to get a simple relationship of the CCDF type."

63,"This expanded public resource of genome variants in global populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation and its role in human disease, and serves as a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of human genetic variation."

75,We apply our approach to extract gene expression relationship between genes and brain regions from literature.
76,"This strategy is likely to improve the performance on datasets where there are more unseen gene names, since the CRF+syntax system is substantially better than the HMM-based one on them. The purpose is to provide the systems with training data from the exact domain they would be applied to, which is the full papers rather than their abstracts."

78,"The main objective of this analysis is to define a list of environmental chemicals that are candidates for the U.S. EPA screening and prioritization process, and to catalog the available toxicology information."
79,"In this study, we explored application of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec for sentiment analysis of clinical discharge summaries. We aim to detect if there exists any underlying bias towards or against a certain disease."

81,"In this groundbreaking book, anthropologist Adriana Petryna takes us deep into the clinical trials industry as it brings together players separated by vast economic and cultural differences. Providing a unique perspective on globalized clinical trials, When Experiments Travel raises central questions: Are such trials exploitative or are they social goods?"

83,"When reidentification of individual contributors is possible, the biobank should work to enable the biobank research system to discharge four core responsibilities to (1) clarify the criteria for evaluating findings and the roster of returnable findings, (2) analyze a particular finding in relation to this, (3) reidentify the individual contributor, and (4) recontact the contributor to offer the finding."

85,"Therefore, a central biobank facility at the Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, was established to contribute to biomedical research and innovation by creating an infrastructure for collecting, storing and managing biomaterial and associated clinical data. The aim of the Radboud Biobank is to offer researchers an infrastructure wherein sub-collections are professionally secured for the long-term according to high quality standards."
86,"Our emphasis on the economic aspect of biobanks allows us to recognize the importance of what we call clinical labor--that is, the regularized, embodied work that members of the national population are expected to perform in their role as biobank participants--in the creation of biovalue through biobanks."

91,"In this work, information theory was employed to characterize the information transmission of a cerebellar granule cell over a region of its excitatory input space following synaptic changes."
92,This endows the cerebellar mossy fibre system with remarkable sensitivity and high fidelity in the transmission of sensory information.
93,"These investigations have highlighted the critical role of Golgi cells in: generating dense clusters of granule cell activity organized in center-surround structures, implementing combinatorial operations on multiple mossy fiber inputs, regulating transmission gain, and cut-off frequency, controlling spike timing and burst transmission, and determining the sign, intensity and duration of long-term synaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber-granule cell relay. This review considers recent advances in the field, highlighting the functional implications of Golgi cells for granular layer network computation and indicating new challenges for cerebellar research."
94,"In this paper, we have performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings of mossy fiber-granule cell LTP in acute rat cerebellar slices and studied its computational implications with a mathematical model."
95,Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text.
