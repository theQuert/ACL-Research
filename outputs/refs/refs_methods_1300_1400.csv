This book will help analysts understand the contribution of decision-analytic modelling to the evaluation of health care programmes. This series is aimed at health economists in academia, the pharmaceutical industry and the health sector, those on advanced health economics courses, and health researchers in associated fields."

68,PURPOSE To examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (N = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.
69,
70,"In this review, the basics of classic reliability theory are addressed in the context of choosing and interpreting an ICC. Inferential tests of mean differences, which are performed in the process of deriving the necessary variance components for the calculation of ICC values, are useful to determine if systematic error is present."
71,"The purpose of this study was to examine the number of days needed to predict habitual PA and sedentary behaviour across pedometer, accelerometer, and physical activity log (PA log) data in older adults."
72,"The purpose of this review is to address important methodological issues related to conducting accelerometer-based assessments of physical activity in free-living individuals.We review the extant scientific literature for empirical information related to the following issues: product selection, number of accelerometers needed, placement of accelerometers, epoch length, and days of monitoring required to estimate habitual physical activity."

76,Objective The primary aim of this study was to determine whether time spent in sedentary behaviors (SED) was associated with 2-hour glucose and insulin resistance in adults with abdominal obesity.
77,
78,We aimed to compare the cardiometabolic risk factor dose-response relationships for physical activity and sedentary behaviour between accelerometer- and questionnaire-based activity measures.Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed in 317 adults by 7-day accelerometry and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
79,
80,"The aim of this study was to determine associations between lipoprotein subclass particle concentrations (-P) and accelerometer-measured SED and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in a sample of healthy adult subjects.Lipoprotein subclass particle concentrations were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, whereas SED and MVPA were measured using Agtigraph GT1M and GT3X+ accelerometers."
81,
82,OBJECTIVE This study examined the association between objectively measured sedentary activity and metabolic syndrome among older adults.
83,"This study examined reliability of accelerometer-based estimates of physical activity levels of overweight and obese adults before and after a lifestyle weight loss program.Participants were overweight and obese (body mass index = 25-45 kg x m) members (n = 1592; 67% female, 42% African American) of the multicenter weight loss maintenance trial."
84,
85,
86,"The purpose of this study was to determine 1) the test-retest reliability of adult accelerometer-measured physical activity, and 2) how data processing decisions affect physical activity levels and test-retest reliability.143 people wore the ActiGraph accelerometer for 2 7-day periods, 1 to 4 weeks apart."
87,"Reducing sedentary time and increasing lifestyle activities, including light-intensity activity, may be an option to help prevent metabolic syndrome (MetS). The purpose of the present study was to examine whether objectively measured light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time is associated with MetS, independent of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA).The participants in this cross-sectional study were 483 middle-aged Japanese adults, aged 30-64 years."
