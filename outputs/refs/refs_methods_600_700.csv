36,This research examines the effects of communication strategies a firm can use to mitigate the impact of these inconsistencies on consumer perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and subsequent beliefs about the firm's social responsibility and attitudes toward the firm.
37,Caren and Panofsky (2005) seek to advance qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) by demonstrating that it can be used to study causal conditions that occur in sequences and introduce a technique they call TQCA (temporal QCA).

39,"This article will identify a pattern of argument that is sufficiently common in regulatory debates that it appears to deserve its own name--""Scientific Certainty"" Argumentation Methods, or SCAMs."

41,"Here we develop a theoretical perspective that explicitly focuses on irresponsibility and that particularly helps explain attributions of social irresponsibility in the minds of the firm's observers. In contrast to approaches in the corporate social responsibility literature that tend to deemphasize the role of the individual perceiver of firm behavior in favor of emphasizing such broader social structures as value systems, institutions, and stakeholder relations, our focus is on how the social reality of external expectations for social responsibility is rooted in the perceptions of the beholder."

69,"Objective: The Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being (CCHS 1.2) is the first national study to use a full version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Using the CCHS 1.2 data, our study aimed to describe the epidemiology of major depression in Canada."
70,"The purpose of this quantitative cross-sectional study was to examine SLE-related issues associated with depression and work-productivity impairment, and to assess if depression mediated the relationship between SLE disease activity and damage and work-productivity impairment."

73,"Objective.The objective of this work was to develop a psychometrically sound questionnaire for measuring the on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment (""work limitations"")."
74,Objective: Several recent studies have documented that substantial functional impairment is associated with many of the mental disorders seen in primary care.
75,"OBJECTIVE There appear to be links between psychiatric disorders and work-related stress as well as between psychiatric disorders and physical conditions. This study explores the relationships between chronic work stress, psychiatric disorders, and chronic physical conditions and disability among workers. By doing so, this study sought to understand how these factors are associated with worker disability when they are experienced alone versus in combination with one another."
