Set in the framework of the interactive information retrieval paradigm, the research examines the micro-dynamics of the information seeking process, and explores search stages that users pursue as they proceed to solve their information problem. The research analyzes the users' information seeking behavior as they move between search stages, and looks for patterns in the transition."

47,"Establishing longer records is essential for understanding mid-Holocene patterns of storminess and their climatic drivers, which will lead to better forecasting of how climate change over the next century may affect tropical cyclone frequency and intensity. Here, we develop this new approach, reconstructing more than 7000 years of North Atlantic hurricane variability using coarse-grained deposits in sediment cores from the leeward margin of the Great Bahama Bank."
