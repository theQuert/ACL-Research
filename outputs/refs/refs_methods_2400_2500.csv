8,"It is therefore important to determine how the heat deposition from particular heating mechanisms varies spatially within coronal structures such as loops or arcades and to compare it to high-quality measurements of the temperature profiles. We propose a new two-part approach to try and solve the coronal heating problem, namely, first of all to use observed temperature profiles to deduce the form of the heating, and second to use that heating form to deduce the likely heating mechanism."
9,An alternative approach is to construct a magnetohydrodynamic coronal loop model that has the ability to predict nanoflare energy distributions. The aims are to calculate the distribution of event energies and to investigate whether kink instability can be predicted from a single parameter.

13,"Aims: This review aimed to investigate the potential barriers and facilitators to high tech AAC provision and its ongoing use. The aim of the analysis was to explore factors underpinning use rather than effectiveness, thus it synthesised data from predominantly qualitative and survey studies reporting the views and perceptions of AAC users or staff providing the devices."

27,"In this paper we review published research describing the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to support societal participation by adolescents and adults with developmental disabilities who require AAC. We focus on three major participation domains: post-secondary education and training, the workplace, and community living and social interaction opportunities."
28,"The purpose of this paper is to review and critique research into the roles of speech output for communication partners, learners, and learner-partner dyads. Research on partner - oriented roles is reviewed in terms of attitudes and perceived communicative competence, and communicative behavior."

30,"The aim of this paper is to validate a methodology for connecting the emission measure of individual solar coronal loops to the integrated emission measure of the entire solar corona and using this connection to deduce the energetic properties of the corona; we then show how this methodology can be applied to observations of solar-like stellar coronae. This work is a further step in our effort to place the ""solar-stellar connection"" on a quantitative footing."
