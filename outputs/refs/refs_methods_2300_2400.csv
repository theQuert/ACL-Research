4,The historical-modeling approach is applicable to any region with good historical records and will enable ecologists and land managers to incorporate insights on hurricane disturbance regimes into the interpretation and conservation of forests at landscape to regional scales.Organismic and Evolutionary Biolog

54,"OBJECTIVE A primary behavioral pathology in drug addiction is the overpowering motivational strength and decreased ability to control the desire to obtain drugs. In this review the authors explore how advances in neurobiology are approaching an understanding of the cellular and circuitry underpinnings of addiction, and they describe the novel pharmacotherapeutic targets emerging from this understanding."

56,"The aim here was to explore non-electronic communication aids as one AAC option and research challenges. This aim was addressed by reviewing funding for the provision of AAC systems, data from an Australian pilot project providing non-electronic communication aids, an audit of aided AAC published studies (2000-2009), and discussion of the review literature."

62,We propose a novel scheme to simulate and observe massless Dirac fermions with cold atoms in a square optical lattice.
63,"This study describes the feasibility of using speech recognition as a text input method for speakers with different degrees of dysarthria. The project investigated two different types of speech recognition systems: Prototype Swedish DragonDictate (PSDD), a speaker-adaptive phoneme-based system, and Infovox RA, a speaker-dependent, whole-word pattern-matching system."

We focus on three major participation domains: post-secondary education and training, the workplace, and community living and social interaction opportunities."
71,"The purpose of this paper is to review and critique research into the roles of speech output for communication partners, learners, and learner-partner dyads. Research on partner - oriented roles is reviewed in terms of attitudes and perceived communicative competence, and communicative behavior."
