10,"It investigates the prospects for accelerated development of a range of low carbon energy supply technologies, and the impact of this acceleration on the decarbonisation of the UK energy system. The report highlights the potentially important role for low carbon supply technology acceleration in the transition to a low carbon energy system in the UK, especially over longer timescales."

16,"This paper examines the experience of existing alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) programs in the US and China to provide insights into appropriate strategies for developing hydrogen vehicles and infrastructure in China. These policies should draw upon resources from both governments and multinational companies to provide incentives for vehicle purchases, promote investment in infrastructure, and disseminate information to raise public awareness."

21,"Objective The aim of the study was to report on HIV and older people in the European Region, including new data stratified by subregion and year."
22,"We therefore aimed to assess changes over calendar time in the risk for HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D), and factors associated with HIV-D risk.Using Concerted Action on Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) data, we analyzed factors associated with time from HIV seroconversion to HIV-D using Cox models with time-updated covariates."
23,"With this in mind, this review seeks to explore areas where HIV (diagnosed or undetected) may impact on the work of clinical geriatricians."

Our answer is that one important aspect of the philosophical temperament is that philosophers are especially reflective: They are less likely than their peers to embrace what seems obvious without questioning it."

76,"This paper presents a framework to understand how conservation, in particular protected areas and national parks, are resisted, based on theories of subaltern politics and a review of thirty-four published case studies. In particular, it recognises the importance of continuing banned livelihood practices such as hunting or farming in resistance, and the particular symbolism this has in conflicts. As well as the theoretical contribution, by showing the variety of responses to this resistance this paper aims to make conservation practitioners more aware of the forms local resistance can take. Rather than being a simple call for a more socially just conservation, it goes beyond this to provide a tool to make conservation better for both local communities and biodiversity"

In fact, the main objective for which the model was initially constructed was to test some propositions implying that variety growth is a necessary requirement for long term economic development."
80,This study was designed to explore the nature of the anomia that is a defining feature of semantic dementia. A particular focus of the study was the impact on naming of a previously unconsidered variable: the typicality of an object within its semantic category.

83,"The paper makes a crucial distinction between the potential value attainable through collaborations and its actual realization. The crux of our argument is that firms enter into collaborative relationships because these are expected to yield superior value relative to alternate organizational forms in certain situations, offering potentially synergistic combinations of complementary resources and capabilities, yet such relationships are frequently prone to failure because the partner firms tend not to recognize ex ante the nature and extent of transaction-specific investment that is required in the collaborative relationship to attain these synergies. In this light, transaction-specific investment in what we term relational specificity becomes imperative."
84,Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the concept of customer value and its role in building switching costs perceptions.
85,"Abstract This article integrates social network and exchange theory to develop a model of customer value based on three relational drivers: relationship quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of relational ties), and contact authority (the decision-making capability of relational contacts)."

93,"A discussion of modularity in language production processes, with special emphasis on processes for retrieving words and building syntactic structures for a to-be-uttered sentence, is presented. The authors' 1st goal was to assess the extent to which information processing is encapsulated between different processing stages. Their 2nd goal was to propose an altemative framework that does not assume strict encapsulation but that maintains multiple levels of integration for production."
