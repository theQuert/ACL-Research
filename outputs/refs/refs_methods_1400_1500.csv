24,"The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review on the governance structures used to extend sustainability to suppliers. More specifically, the authors aim to answer two questions: ""What is the impact of these mechanisms or governance structures on sustainable performance?"""
25,"In a multiple case study of seven European chemical companies, we investigate how firms manage their supplier relations in interdependent situations."
26,"This paper presents a qualitative study that considered how clinicians constructed the role of the 'ethical' in their everyday practice. An attention to areas of settled morality, usually rendered invisible by their very nature, enables us to see how clinicians manage the 'ethical' in their practice."
27,"This paper starts by exploring the development of Science, Technology and Society (STS) in the UK in the late 1960s, emphasising its interdiciplinary roots, and comparing and contrasting it with the concerns of Sociology. It notes, in consistency with the Foucauldian approach, that material semiotics implies that knowledge traditions are performative, helping to create the realities that they describe."

32,"In this groundbreaking book, anthropologist Adriana Petryna takes us deep into the clinical trials industry as it brings together players separated by vast economic and cultural differences. Providing a unique perspective on globalized clinical trials, When Experiments Travel raises central questions: Are such trials exploitative or are they social goods?"
33,"This article uses notions of ""public talk"" and ""regulation as facilitation"" to develop an account of public bioethics in the UK as a form of scientific governance, drawing on document analysis and expert interviews. First, this article will show the ""ethical"" problematization of scientific governance in the UK through the emergence of the Human Genetics Commission (HGC), Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCB), and Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The article then questions whether the authority to categorize publics and identify ""proper"" ethical positions reintroduces problems of expertise in a new form."
34,
35,"In this article, I wish to reframe this 'public understanding of science' project, and place fresh emphasis on public understandings of research: an engagement with the everyday laboratory practices of biomedicine and its associated ethics, rather than with specific scientific facts. Drawing on the perspectives of participants in my own sociological research on the social and ethical dimensions of neuroscience, I argue that public understanding of biomedical research and its ethics should be developed both at the community level and within the research moment itself in order to enhance autonomy and promote more socially robust science."
36,"This article interrogates this 'therapeutic promise ' of neuroscience through the case study of the psychiatric condition personality disorder. Specifically, the focus is on the promissory discourse of clinicians specialising in the management of two variants of personality disorder) antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy) and researchers investigating the neurobiology of these constructs."
37,"In this paper, we explore the dynamics of expertise and their implications for the lay-expert divide at a series of public events about the new genetics."
38,This lecture traces the theme of opening black boxes in the sociology of science.
39,
40,"In this essay I argue for a thin,``core'' conception of feminism that is easy tounderstand and difficult to reject."
41,"This essay traces the way in which this invisible gendering of the universal renders the other gender invisible and silent. It shows how this attenuation of the human in 'man ' is a source of sickness, both cultural and individual."
42,This paper sketches an account of public health ethics drawing upon established scholarship in feminist ethics.
43,
44,This paper draws upon data from a qualitative empirical study to investigate parents' use of the moral ideal of authenticity as part of their narrative justifications for dosing decisions and actions. I argue that this investigation of parents' moral justifications and dosing dilemmas raises questions about the validity of authenticity as a transcendent moral principle.
45,

47,In this paper we explore a range of lay people's accounts of drawing the line.
48,This paper argues that we should not make this concession and that ethical regulation is fundamentally wrong because the damage that it inflicts on a democratic society far exceeds any harm that HSS research is capable of causing to individuals.

51,"This paper explores responses of geneticists interviewed in the UK, the USA and Russia about the cultural meanings of their work."
52,"In this paper we explore some of the clinical, technical, social and ethical factors that might help to explain this situation. We focus here on their articulations of social and ethical, as well as scientific, dimensions in the contingent classification of 'spare' embryos, entailing uncertainty, fluidity and naturalisation in classifying work."

55,"This paper presents results from interviews with clinicians who are beginning to use pharmacogenetics and explores how they view the ethics of pharmacogenetic testing, its use to exclude some patients from treatment, and how this kind of testing fits into broader debates around genetics. In particular this paper examines the attitudes of breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease specialists."
56,"This paper presents an overview of tendencies in sociological and anthropological studies of morality, ethics and bioethics, and suggests that a lack in philosophical interest might be related to a tendency among social scientists to employ either a deficit model (social science perspectives accommodate the sense of context that philosophical ethics lacks), a replacement model (social scientists have finally found the ""right way"" of doing ethics), or a dismissal model (ethics should be abandoned all together as a misconstrued veil of power)."
57,"In this article, I suggest that the inclination to keep bodies apart from 'commercial exchange' has significant implications for the way their parts come to be exchanged. I focus on the mechanisms that allow money to be generated despite the moral ideal viewing body parts as beyond trade--or, rather, the how the ideal facilitates mechanisms through which money can be generated without being viewed as profit."

60,"This article presents a theoretical discussion of public bioethics bodies as boundary organizations and examines them in terms of relationship to the moral and cognitive authority of science and other forms of expertise, mechanisms for public participation in controversial science policy, and the deployment of consensus models."
61,"Focusing on four themes found in recent sociological research in bioethics - ethics of research, the creation of moral boundaries, bioethics and social policy, and the bioethical imagination - this anthology offers practical models of co-operative work where the strengths of each discipline are brought together to advance our understanding of bioethical issues and to show the way toward just and effective social policy."

86,This study illustrates that the application of graph models to genetic data from tumor sets provide new information on the interrelationships among genetic changes during tumor progression.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.
87,"Here we describe a computational approach, called Retracing the Evolutionary Steps in Cancer (RESIC), to deduce the temporal sequence of genetic events during tumorigenesis from cross-sectional genomic data of tumors at their fully transformed stage. RESIC represents the first evolutionary mathematical approach to identify the temporal sequence of mutations driving tumorigenesis and may be useful to guide the validation of candidate genes emerging from cancer genome surveys."
88,"In the current study, we provide a novel mathematical model that begins to address this challenge."
