1,The purpose of this study was to examine the construct of forgiveness within the context of a reversal theory framework.
2,
3,The implications of individual differences in motivational orientation for cognitive engagement and self-regulation in the classroom are discussed.
4,"To this end, this research aimed at investigating the use of Bayesian networks for predicting performance of a student, based on values of some identified attributes."
5,
6,"This paper examines the conceptual usefulness of distinguishing between two aspects of learning goals, namely direction and effort. This research builds upon and integrates three bodies of research related to self-regulation of learning, Boekaerts' work on the significance of cognitive, affective and motivational appraisals of study, Kuhl's notion of action control, and our previous work on qualitative differences in students' learning goals."

10,"The current study attempted to overcome various methodological limitations associated with many previous studies to examine the potency of the traits of the `five factor model of personality' in predicting academic success up to 3 years later, both directly and when controlling for intelligence and `application' (used as a proxy for motivation)."

12,"In Stealth Assessment, Valerie Shute and Matthew Ventura investigate an approach that embeds performance-based assessments in digital games. They argue that using well-designed games as vehicles to assess and support learning will help combat students' growing disengagement from school, provide dynamic and ongoing measures of learning processes and outcomes, and offer students opportunities to apply such complex competencies as creativity, problem solving, persistence, and collaboration. These stealth assessments are intended to measure levels of creativity, persistence, and conceptual understanding of Newtonian physics during game play."
13,"We propose a nontrivial strategy to parallelize a series of data mining and machine learning problems, including 1-class and 2-class support vector machines, nonnegative least square problems, and $ ell_1$ regularized regression (LASSO) problems."

17,We propose and demonstrate a methodology for building tractable normative intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs).
18,It emphasizes the importance of articulating inferences one wants to make and the evidence needed to support those inferences.
19,"A novel approach is proposed to help schools improve attendance that leverages the market target model, which is built on association rule mining and probability theory, to target sessions that are most impactful to overall poor attendance."
20,"This paper suggests that for academics to be good teachers, especially in the context of e-Learning, they need to understand learning. This is especially important with the associated changes in higher education as we move towards the knowledge society. A program for promoting conceptual change in academics' approaches to teaching is outlined"
21,"This study examined creativity, age and gender as predictors of academic achievement."
22,
23,"Our purpose in this paper is threefold: firstly to introduce some research which has and is being carried out at University College Cork on the effectiveness of performance in the Leaving Certificate examination and in such alternatives as scholastic aptitude and personality tests, as measures of subsequent university performance; secondly, to suggest some statistical methodology for the analysis of data in this area; and thirdly to offer some personal comments on aspects of the overall problem in an effort to establish a fair and hopefully constructive viewpoint and to redress some misconceptions."
24,This essay describes how intelligence can be viewed as developing expertise.
25,"The research described includes sport-specific research but also studies that focus on general motivational principles that look beyond sport-specific phenomena. We propose that attentional, rather than limited resource, explanations of self-control have more value for athletic performance."
26,"Abstract The objective of this study was to obtain evidence of the convergent and factor validity of the Reduced Scale of Big Five Personality Factors (ER5FP), with 20 items, and of the Reduced Inventory of Big Five Personality Factors (IGFP-5R), with 32 items."
27,"Purpose of the present study was to test a conceptual model of relations among achievement goal orientation, self-efficacy, cognitive processing, and achievement of students working within a particular collaborative task context."
28,
29,"This paper argues for increased and formal communication and collaboration between these communities in order to share research, methods, and tools for data mining and analysis in the service of developing both LAK and EDM fields."
30,
31,This study was conducted to determine the validity of noncognitive and cognitive predictors of the performance of college students at the end of their 4th year in college.
32,"EDM is poised to leverage an enormous amount of research from data mining community and apply that research to educational problems in learning, cognition and assessment. This paper surveys the history and applications of data mining techniques in the educational field. The objective is to introduce data mining to traditional educational system, web-based educational system, intelligent tutoring system, and e-learning."
33,This special issue of JEDM was dedicated to bridging work done in the disciplines of educational and psychological assessment and educational data mining (EDM) via the assessment design and implementation framework of evidence-centered design (ECD).

35,"For the purpose of this paper we critique a 'closed' view of learning analytics as focusing only on data produced by students' interactions with institutions of higher learning. This paper explores some of these challenges, paradoxes and opportunities with reference to two mega ODL institutions namely the Open University in the UK (OU) and the University of South Africa (Unisa)."

47,"This study investigated the question of whether a student's expectancy, values and negative affect influenced their deep information processing approach and achievement at the end of the first and second academic year."
48,
49,"In this paper, we extend the application of bagging to time series settings with asymmetric cost functions, particularly for predicting signs and quantiles."
50,"The aim of this study was to investigate the direction of the effect between goal orientation, self-regulation and learning strategies in order to understand the impact of these three constructs on students' achievement."
51,"Es recomendable seguir investigando sobre sus propiedades psicometricas en el futuro en otras poblaciones similares.The aim of this research was to determine the psychometric properties (construct validity and internal consistency) of The Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) in health sciences students from Cartagena, Colombia."
52,This thesis details a longitudinal study on factors that influence introductory  programming success and on the development of machine learning  models to predict incoming student performance. This thesis makes three fundamental contributions.
53,This paper focuses on predicting drop-out and school failure when student data has been enriched with data derived from students social behaviour.
54,"The aim of this study is to explore to what extent psychometric IQ and scholastic achievement, as assessed by the CITO high school entrance test, are correlated."
55,
56,This paper describes work carried out to explore the role of a learning companion as a teachable student of the human student.

84,This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. The article is aimed on bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials.
