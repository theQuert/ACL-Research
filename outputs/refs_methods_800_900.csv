0,"This dissertation proposes several solutions to the advancement of network analysis theories and methods with specific applications in the domains of social, organizational, and crisis scenarios. In this thesis, I present substantive insights into the application of several network analysis theories and applications to the (1) social, (2) organizational, and (3) crisis response settings. Altogether, this work contributes to the growing literature on the theories and applications of network analysis to real-world social networks."

3,"The main objective of the""Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change"" project is to collect and protect the genetic diversity of a portfolio of plants with the characteristics required for adapting the world's most important food crops to climate change. The initiative also aims to make available this diversity in a form that plant breeders can readily use to produce varieties adapted to the new climatic conditions that farmers, particularly in the developing world, are already encountering. This paper serves to inform interested researchers of this important initiative and encourage collaboration under its umbrella."

29,This review reports on the research done during past years on violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) in glassy systems. It is focused on the existence of a quasi-fluctuation-dissipation theorem (QFDT) in glassy systems and the current supporting knowledge gained from numerical simulation studies. This review is intended for inexpert readers who want to learn about the basic notions and concepts related to the existence of the QFDT as well as for the more expert readers who may be interested in more specific results.
30,"Here, we propose an alternative exploratory analysis."
31,ABSTRACT:We explore several random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energy variants within the adiabatic-connection fluctuationdissipation theorem approach.

53,"In this review, I present the evidence for the reduced reproductive effort life histories of primates and discuss the ways that such life-history tactics are understood in contemporary theory. I discuss recent applications of life-history theory to human evolution and emphasize the continuity between models used to explain peculiarities of human reproduction and senescence with the long, slow life histories of primates more generally"
