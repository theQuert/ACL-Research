17,"We propose that the crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species is the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions: shared intentionality. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality)."

19,This paper reports 2 studies that explore the role of joint attentional processes in the child's acquisition of language.

28,"In this review, the basics of nonequilibrium thermodynamics are described, as well as how these apply to Earth system processes. This perspective is likely to allow us to better understand and predict its function as one entity, how it has evolved in the past, and how it is modified by human activities in the future."

30,"This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for the biosphere has persisted ever since. This paper presents a new view of the atmosphere, one in which it is seen as a component part of the biosphere rather than as a mere environment for life. This approach applied to the present problem of the anomaly of the chemical distribution of the gases of the atmosphere, offers a strong suggestion that the Earth's atmosphere is more than merely anomalous; it appears to be a contrivance specifically constituted for a set of purposes. This paper examines the hypothesis that the total ensemble of living organisms which constitute the biosphere can act as a single entity to regulate chemical composition, surface pH and possibly also climate."

44,We discuss what implications this context-dependency has for understanding the development of an ontological distinction between solids and nonsolids.
45,This demonstration highlights the over-simplicity of one-word learning paradigms and the need for a shift in word learning paradigms where more than one word is taught to ensure children disambiguate objects on the basis of their names rather than their degree of salience
46,The current study examines the relations between the statistics of the nouns young children learn and the similarities and differences in the biases they demonstrate.

50,Developmental research is positioned to address this debate by jointly identifying the source(s) of limitations and the mechanism(s) underlying capacity increases.

65,We propose that biases in attitude and stereotype formation might arise as a result of learned differences in the extent to which social groups have previously been predictive of behavioral or physical properties.

69,"A 2-day consensus conference was held to examine scientific and ethical issues in the application of deep brain stimulation for treating mood and behavioral disorders, such as major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome.The primary objectives of the conference were to (1) establish consensus among participants about the design of future clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and (2) develop standards for the protection of human subjects participating in such studies.Conference participants identified 16 key points for guiding research in this growing field.The adoption of the described guidelines would help to protect the safety and rights of research subjects who participate in clinical trials of deep brain stimulation for disorders of mood, behavior, and thought and have further potential to benefit other stakeholders in the research process, including clinical researchers and device manufactures."
