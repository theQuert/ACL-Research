2. Experiment Design: Design three experiments to test the conscious knowledge of the bigrams constituting the grammatical letter strings. Experiment 1 can replicate the initial study phase of Reber's experiments, where subjects study a set of grammatical letter strings generated from the synthetic grammar. Experiment 2 can involve subjects studying a list of the bigrams making up these grammatical strings. Experiment 3 can involve a control group of healthy individuals participating in a similar study.

3. Task Execution: In each experiment, after the study phase, participants are asked to categorize new letter strings as grammatical or ungrammatical based on their previous exposure to the bigrams or the full grammatical strings. The categorization process can be measured by accuracy and reaction time.

4. Data Collection: Collect data on the grammaticality judgments made by participants in each experiment, including accuracy, reaction time, and any self-reported conscious awareness of the grammar's rules.

This could provide valuable first-hand information on the challenges they face in processing linear word order and how it impacts their ability to form coherent sentences.

Secondly, a quantitative approach could involve conducting structured language processing tasks with a sample of individuals diagnosed with different variants of PPA, including logopenic, nonfluent/agrammatic, and semantic variants. These tasks could be designed to specifically assess their ability to process and comprehend linear word order in sentences. The results of these tasks could then be analyzed to identify any specific patterns or differences in word order processing abilities between the different PPA variants.

Additionally, brain imaging techniques such as MRI or fMRI could be used to investigate the neural correlates of word order processing in individuals with logopenic PPA. This could help in understanding the specific brain regions or networks involved in word order processing and how they may be affected in PPA.

In summary, by combining qualitative interviews, structured language processing tasks, and neuroimaging techniques, the research methodology aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of word order processing abilities in individuals with logopenic PPA, and how it differs from other variants of PPA.
