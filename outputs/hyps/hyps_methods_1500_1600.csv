16,"To bridge the gap between the background knowledge and the stated objectives, a research methodology can be developed to investigate the underlying synchronization in dancers during movement creation. This can be achieved through a mixed-method approach that combines quantitative and qualitative research methods.

First, a quantitative approach can be used to measure the underlying synchronization in dancers. This can involve the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), to assess the neural mechanisms involved in movement creation. Specifically, the three measures inspired by nonlinear dynamical system theory - index based on generalized synchronization, index based on mean phase coherence, and index of phase synchrony based on entropy - can be applied to analyze the synchronization patterns in the dancers' brains during the tasking process.

Additionally, a qualitative approach can be utilized to gain insights into the mental representations and cognitive processes involved in movement creation. This can involve in-depth interviews and observational studies with the dancers to understand their individual experiences and the role of mental imagery and decision making in their choreographic practice.

Furthermore, collaboration with cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and dance professionals can provide a multidisciplinary perspective and expertise in interpreting the findings and understanding the implications for enhancing choreographic practice.

By combining quantitative measurements of synchronization with qualitative insights into cognitive processes, the research methodology effectively bridges the gap between the background knowledge of Wayne McGregor's approach to movement creation and the objective of assessing underlying synchronization in dancers.

In order to bridge the gap between the background knowledge and the stated objectives of the research, a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methods could be utilized. 

First, a qualitative approach involving in-depth interviews with Wayne McGregor and other choreographers, as well as dancers who have participated in task-based movement creation, could provide valuable insight into the cognitive processes and mental representations involved in the creation of movement. This qualitative data could help to enrich the understanding of the tasking approach and provide context for the subsequent quantitative analyses.

Secondly, a quantitative approach utilizing neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could be employed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying movement creation and creativity. This could involve scanning dancers and choreographers while they engage in task-based movement creation, and then analyzing the neural activity associated with divergent thinking and creative achievement. The use of FreeSurfer image analysis suite for cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation could provide valuable data on specific brain regions associated with creative cognition in the context of dance.

Additionally, the consensual assessment technique (Amabile, 1982) used to rank the creative products of the subjects could be augmented with qualitative feedback from experts in the field of dance and choreography. This could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the creative products and their relevance within the context of choreographic practice.

Overall, the mixed-methods approach would allow for a comprehensive exploration of the cognitive and neural processes underlying task-based movement creation, and would provide a nuanced understanding of the mental representations and neural mechanisms involved in creative choreography. This methodology effectively bridges the gap between the background knowledge and the stated objectives by integrating qualitative insights with quantitative neuroimaging data, ultimately contributing to the development of tools to enhance choreographic practice."
