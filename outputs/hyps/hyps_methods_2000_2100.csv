This can involve mapping the core modules of the cognitive architecture onto specific cognitive tasks and examining how these processes may be associated with burnout symptoms.

Finally, integrating neuroscientific techniques such as fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of burnout among clergy members can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.

By utilizing a mixed-method approach that incorporates quantitative analysis, qualitative interviews, cognitive architecture framework, and neuroscientific techniques, the proposed research methodology effectively bridges the gap between the existing background knowledge and the stated objectives, providing a comprehensive and multidimensional investigation of burnout among clergy members."
