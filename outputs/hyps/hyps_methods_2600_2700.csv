3,"To effectively bridge the gap between the background information and the stated objective, the research methodology should be designed to specifically address the different perspectives of patients and physicians in the context of euthanasia requests. A mixed-methods approach can be used to gather and analyze data from both patients and physicians.

First, in-depth interviews with a topic list should be conducted with the 10 patients who explicitly requested euthanasia but whose request was not granted or performed, as well as with the eight physicians of these patients. The interviews should aim to understand the patients' perspectives on their suffering and their reasons for requesting euthanasia, as well as the physicians' perspectives on evaluating and responding to these requests.

Similarly, in-depth interviews with the eight physicians of patients who had requested euthanasia but had died before the request was granted or performed, or died after the request was refused or withdrawn, should also be conducted. These interviews can provide insights into the physicians' decision-making process and their perspectives on assessing patient suffering in the context of euthanasia requests.

Additionally, a framework for assessing patient suffering in the context of euthanasia requests should be developed, drawing from the literature on different aspects of suffering as well as insights gathered from the interviews. This framework can be used as a tool for physicians to consider and evaluate the various dimensions of patient suffering when faced with euthanasia requests.

Overall, the mixed-methods approach of in-depth interviews with patients and physicians, combined with the development of a framework for assessing patient suffering, will provide a comprehensive understanding of the different perspectives involved in euthanasia requests and help to address the problem of different perspectives identified in the background information."
