3,"In this work, we identify the major explicit activation networks by carrying out an image-based activation network analysis of thousands of separate activation maps derived from the BrainMap database of functional imaging studies, involving nearly 30,000 human subjects."
4,"Here we describe and validate an automated brain-mapping framework that uses text-mining, meta-analysis and machine-learning techniques to generate a large database of mappings between neural and cognitive states."
5,"Here we investigate the possibility, suggested by several convergent lines of research, that task-unrelated thought is associated with a reduction in the trial-to-trial phase consistency of the oscillatory neural signal in response to perceptual input."

17,"Abstract The aim of this paper is to propose a novel approach to integrate financial information, incorporating the dependence structure among the variables in the model. This approach permits to aggregate information and to calibrate the results obtained with different sources of data."

20,"The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertaintyand offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences."

28,This review introduces important concepts of phase transitions and discusses the interplay of quantum and classical fluctuations near criticality. The main part of the article is devoted to bulk quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems. The article is aimed on bridging the gap between high-level theoretical presentations and research papers specialized in certain classes of materials.

46,These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments.
47,Its strength and importance lie in the fact that it brings together a world-wide collection of studies of the archaeology of mobility.This book provides a ready-made reference to this world-wide phenomenon and is unique in that it tries to redefine pastoralism within a larger context by the term mobility.
48,"In this paper we discuss the relations between cognitive maps, spatial abilities and human wayfinding, particularly in the context of traveling without the use of sight. Initially we discuss the nature of cognitive maps and the process of cognitive mapping as mechanisms for developing person to object (egocentric) and object to object (allocentric) internal representations. We explore the connection between environmental learning and cognitive maps in the context of learning a route in two different cultural environments-Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Santa Barbara (California)."

53,"This article reviews those consequences, with a focus on the distinctive ways people perceive, evaluate, and interact with members of human categories they essentialize."
54,"The aim of this prospective randomized intervention study was to evaluate the outcome at a 2 and 5 year follow-up whether combined arthroscopic surgery followed by exercise therapy was superior to the same exercise therapy alone when treating non-traumatic, degenerative medial meniscal tears.Ninety-six middle-aged patients with MRI-verified degenerative medial meniscus tear and radiographic osteoarthritis grade <=1 (Ahlback) participated in the study."

59,The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of spontaneous recovery (no supervised training) of muscle torques in the first 3 months postarthroscopic partial meniscectomy.
60,
61,SummaryThe aim of this study was to assess the effects in humans of early (2 weeks) and delayed (6 weeks) isokinetic strength training in the recovery of muscle strength following an arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.
62,
63,"The aim of this study was to identify reductions in different aspects of muscle strength as well as objectively measured and self-reported lower extremity function in middle-aged patients who had undergone a meniscectomy compared with controls.Thirty-one patients who had undergone surgery in 2006 and 2007 (mean +- SD age 46 +- 6 years, mean +- SD body mass index [BMI] 26 +- 4 kg/m(2), and mean +- SD postsurgery 21 +- 6 months) and 31 population-based controls (mean +- SD age 46 +- 6 years and mean +- SD BMI 26 +- 4 kg/m(2)) were examined for maximal muscle strength and rapid force capacity, distance achieved during the one-leg hop test, and the maximum number of knee bends performed in 30 seconds."

70,Here we draw on evidence that has recently emerged from a series of investigations in central Mexico to evaluate the long-term human impact on the environment and to establish the impact that late Holocene changes in the climate have had on the indigenous populations that lived on the arid frontier of Mesoamerica.
71,In this paper we draw together information from a variety of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct fluctuations in the climate of central Mexico over the last 600 years.
