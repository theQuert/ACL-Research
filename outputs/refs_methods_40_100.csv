0,"The objective of this study was to identify possible obstacles to carrying out competent early identification and brief intervention (EIBI) of heavy drinkers in primary health care. The main actions to be taken to promote brief intervention are to educate professionals about the content of early-phase heavy drinking and to produce directing, but not excessively demanding guidelines for carrying out EIBI."

6,We sought to test the hypothesis that the statistical artefact regression to the mean (RTM) explains part of the reduction in such studies.
7,OBJECTIVE To appraise evidence on the association of CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel response through systematic review and meta-analysis.

10,The aim of the current study is to identify the human cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms involved in the two oxidative steps in the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its pharmacologically active metabolite.

13,Multiple platelet function tests claim to be P2Y12-pathway specific and capable of capturing the biological activity of clopidogrel.The aim of the present study was to determine which platelet function test provides the best reflection of the in vivo plasma levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel (AMC).Clopidogrel-naive patients scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) received a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin.

21,The aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of dual high on-treatment platelet reactivity (DAPR) and its impact on clinical outcome.On-treatment platelet reactivity was measured in parallel by ADP- and arachidonic acid-induced light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) (n=921) and the point-of-care VerifyNow system (P2Y12 and aspirin) (n=422) in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing elective stent implantation.
22,"ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess the effects of different proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel.BackgroundMetabolism of clopidogrel requires cytochrome P450s (CYPs), including CYP2C19."
23,
24,Objective: To evaluate the interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
25,"Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms for drug interactions in this setting."
26,Objective To evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the platelet response to aspirin in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
27,
28,OBJECTIVE To examine the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes related to concomitant use of PPIs and clopidogrel compared with that of PPIs alone in adults hospitalized for myocardial infarction.
29,
30,"This study aimed to investigate and compare the impact of omeprazole and rabeprazole on the antiplatelet action of clopidogrel among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).A prospective, randomized, open-labeled study was conducted among 87 CAD patients receiving clopidogrel and aspirin."
31,Objective To evaluate the capability of multiple platelet function tests to predict clinical outcome.
32,We sought to evaluate whether the use of PPIs with clopidogrel was associated with worse clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with the use of clopidogrel alone.We studied 2651 consecutive patients discharged alive after coronary stenting for stable or unstable coronary artery disease between 2001 and 2007.
33,"The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different PPIs (pantoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole) on platelet response to clopidogrel in patients with previous coronary stent placement under chronic clopidogrel treatment."

58,"Here, we review recent work on the neural mechanisms underlying multistable perception and how such work has contributed to understanding the neural correlates of consciousness. Particular emphasis is put on the role of high-level brain mechanisms that are involved in actively selecting and interpreting sensory information, and their interactions with lower-level processes that are more directly concerned with the processing of sensory stimulus properties"
59,"The goal of the present study was to examine relationships between individual differences in resting state functional connectivity as ascertained by fMRI (rs-fcMRI) and performance on tasks of executive function (EF), broadly defined as the ability to regulate thoughts and actions."
