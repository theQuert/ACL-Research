12,"This paper studies what determines group formation and the degree of participation when the population is heterogeneous, both in terms of income and race or ethnicity. We are especially interested in whether and how much the degree of heterogeneity in communities influences the amount of participation in different types of groups."

21,"This course will deal with the foundations of social theory, starting with the French and Scottish Enlightenments and the beginnings of a specifically sociological worldview."
22,"This dissertation examines the processes and outcomes of welfare regimes reforms in eleven Latin American countries, between 1980 and 2010. In so doing, it confronts three theoretical goals. Socioeconomic change, fiscal strain, and transnational factors, interact to make the expansion of social protection contingent upon redistributions of burdens and benefits guaranteed to trigger resistance from groups privileged by existing schemes. The strategic challenge for reformist politicians is the crafting of formulas aimed at simultaneously neutralizing potential veto coalitions and mobilizing unprotected populations."

32,"By combining good historical records of bird introductions with the detailed information available on many other aspects of avian biology, this book advances understanding of the invasion process while also exploring avian conservation biology, and basic principles of ecology and evolution."
33,
34,
35,"Aim  Trait-based risk assessment for invasive species is becoming an important tool for identifying non-indigenous species that are likely to cause harm. Our goal was to test risk assessment performance across a range of taxonomic and geographical scales, at different points in the invasion process, with a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms."
36,Aim    Identifying climatic niche shifts and their drivers is important for the accurate prediction of the risk of biological invasions.
37,
38,
39,"Aim Niche conservatism, or the extent to which niches are conserved across space and time, is of special concern for the study of non-native species as it underlies predictions of invasion risk."
40,"Aim - Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data.|2."

44,Aim: Climate change and the ability of alien populations to realize different climatic niches compared to native populations pose challenges for pre-empting invasion risk. We call for greater dialogue to identify and standardize a comprehensive system for incorporating these challenging issues into WRA systems to ensure that they remain effective in reducing the weed risk into the future.13 page(s

46,This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed.
47,"Here, we present a new global analysis of avian subspecies and show that 36% of avian subspecies are, in fact, phylogenetically distinct."
48,A key challenge in ecology is to define species' niches on the basis of functional traits.
49,

51,
52,Aim  Some invasive species succeed particularly well and manage to establish populations across a wide variety of regions and climatic conditions.
53,"I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment."
54,"In view of this, management efforts should concentrate on invasives that have detrimental effects on native biota. Our aims were to identify the habitat characteristics that influence ring-necked parakeet abundance in Belgium and to assess the effects of competition for nesting cavities with native hole-nesters."
55,
56,
57,
58,"Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales."
59,
60,Our study underlines the opportunistic granivorous-frugivorous character of this parakeet species and the possible role of human food sources in the success of its establishment in many cities across temperate Europe.
61,This climate matching approach relies on the assumption that invasive species conserve their climatic niche in the invaded ranges.
62,
63,
64,We present a quantitative bioeconomic modelling framework to analyse risks from non-indigenous species to economic activity and the environment.

68,The aim of this paper is to compare existing and new presenceonly evaluators to usual presence/absence measures.
69,"We propose that recent adaptation within the native range, in particular adaptations to human-altered habitat, could also contribute to the evolution of invasive populations."

80,"Here we present a new paradigm for the regulation of energy supply within the organism. In this 'Selfish Brain Theory', the neocortex and limbic system play a central role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as anorexia nervosa and obesity"
81,
82,"In this review, we specifically address the question how leptin resistance contributes to enhanced craving for (palatable) food. Since dopamine is a key player in the motivation for food, the interconnection between dopamine, leptin and neuropeptides related to feeding will be discussed. Understanding the mechanisms by which these neuropeptidergic systems hijack the homeostatic feeding mechanisms, thus leading to overeating and obesity is the primary aim of this review. The melanocortin system, one of the crucial neuropeptidergic systems modulating feeding behavior will be extensively discussed."
83,"In this paper, we highlight how an excess of dietary carbohydrates, particularly fructose, alongside a relative deficiency in dietary fats and cholesterol, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease."
84,
85,"It is suggested that the hypothalamic satiety mechanism is concerned only in the prevention of an overall surplus of energy intake over expenditure, which would cause the deposition of fat in the depots."

91,Purpose of reviewCarbohydrate during exercise has been demonstrated to improve exercise performance even when the exercise is of high intensity (>75% VO2max) and relatively short duration (~1 h).
92,This is an important area of exploration for mixed methods researchers who seek to improve the validity of their findings.

97,The purpose of this study was to measure the influence of breathing frequency (BF) on heart rate variability (HRV) and specifically on the Low Frequency/High Frequency (LF/HF) ratio in athletes.
98,
99,"This review identifies a series of problems with the methods of doing so-the interpretation of low-frequency spectral power, the multiple use of equivalent normalized low frequency (LFnu), high frequency (HFnu) and ratio (LF/HF) terms, and the lack of control over extraneous variables, and reviews research in the calendar year 2012 to determine their prevalence and severity."
