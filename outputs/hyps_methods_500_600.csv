50,"To bridge the gap between the background and the stated objectives, a mixed method research approach can be utilized. This approach will include both quantitative and qualitative methods to address the research questions comprehensively.

Quantitative Research:
To address the objective of examining the efficacy of group CBT in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED), a quantitative research methodology can be employed. A randomized controlled trial can be conducted to compare the effectiveness of group CBT with other modes of therapy, individual CBT, self-help CBT, and waiting list control. Participants diagnosed with BN and BED can be recruited and randomly assigned to different treatment groups. Pre- and post-intervention measures of binge eating frequency, severity of symptoms, and functional impairment can be assessed using standardized assessment tools such as the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) and the Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA). Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA or regression analysis, can be performed to compare the outcomes across different treatment groups.

Qualitative Research:
To address the objective of exploring the experience of binge eating and loss of control for individuals with BN, a qualitative research methodology can be employed. Semi-structured interviews can be conducted with individuals diagnosed with BN to understand their lived experiences of binge eating and loss of control. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) can be used to analyze the interview data and identify themes that capture the participants' subjective experiences. The themes identified from the qualitative analysis can provide rich insights into the psychological and emotional aspects of binge eating and loss of control experienced by individuals with BN.

Integration of Findings:
The findings from the quantitative and qualitative research can be integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of group CBT in treating BN and BED, as well as the subjective experiences of individuals with BN. The quantitative results can provide evidence of treatment effectiveness, while the qualitative findings can offer in-depth insights into the lived experiences and perceptions of individuals undergoing treatment for BN.

99,"The objective of this research is to bridge the gap between the background knowledge of the link between childhood chest illnesses and respiratory symptoms in later life and the stated objective of investigating the time course of functional disturbances related to asthma and persistence of structural lung damage. To achieve this objective, a mixed-methods research approach can be employed. 

First, a quantitative approach can be used to analyze the data from the cohort study of 10,557 British children born in one week in 1958. This would involve conducting statistical analysis to identify the prevalence and incidence of respiratory symptoms such as cough and phlegm in childhood and their association with the development of asthma or wheezy bronchitis in later life. This analysis would help in understanding the longitudinal patterns of respiratory symptoms and their relationship with asthma.

Second, a qualitative approach can be utilized to conduct interviews or focus groups with individuals who have a history of childhood chest illnesses and are currently experiencing respiratory symptoms in later life. This qualitative data can provide insights into the individual experiences of living with respiratory symptoms, the impact on daily life, and the perceived relationship with their childhood chest illnesses. 

Additionally, physiological measurements and lung function tests can be conducted to assess the presence of functional disturbances related to asthma and any evidence of structural lung damage in individuals with a history of childhood chest illnesses and respiratory symptoms in later life. This would provide further evidence on the potential mechanisms underlying the observed continuity between childhood chest illnesses and respiratory symptoms in adulthood.
