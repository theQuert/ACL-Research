'### METHOD:\n\nThe problem at hand is the time-consuming nature of decoding in the k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (kNNMT). To address this, we propose a two-fold approach:\n\n1. **Subset Search**: Rather than retrieving neighbor target tokens from all sentences, we suggest limiting the search within a subset. This subset could be formed based on certain pre-determined criteria or by using machine learning algorithms to identify the most relevant pieces of information. By doing so, we can significantly reduce the search space and hence improve the decoding speed. This method is rooted on the assumption that the most \'relevant\' or \'similar\' tokens to a given input sentence would likely be contained within a smaller subset of the overall sentence base.\n\n2. **Efficient Distance Computation**: This method involves creating a look-up table based on efficient distance computation techniques. The look-up table will contain pre-computed distances between tokens in the subset, which can be directly retrieved, eliminating the need to compute these distances during decoding. This will make the neighbor search quicker. \n\nWith this method, we propose to re-coins the traditional kNN-MT into a "Subset kNN-MT". This approach should boost the decoding speed substantially while retaining or even improving the accuracy of translated text. Integrated testing on WMTâ€™19 German-to-English and other translation tasks will be required to validate this method.'
