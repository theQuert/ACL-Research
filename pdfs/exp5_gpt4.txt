'### RESEARCH METHOD:\n\nGiven the goal to improve the decoding speed of kNN machine translation, the research applied experimental and quantitative methods with the following steps:\n\n1. **Proposal of the "Subset kNN-MT" Model**: The primary step in our methodology is proposing a new model which makes use of subsets for neighbor search and an efficient distance computation technique with a lookup table. Our model is an evolved variant of the initial model (kNN-MT) that we believe will efficiently address the issue of slow decoding.\n\n2. **Experiment Setup**: Under the experimental setup, we establish datasets for German-to-English translation task (WMT\'19) and German-to-English and English-to-Japanese domain adaptation tasks. We proceed to implement kNN-MT and subset kNN-MT models on these datasets.\n\n3. **Comparison & Evaluation**: We compare the performance of our new model (subset kNN-MT) and the existing model (kNN-MT) based on their decoding speed and BLEU scores. We record the results for a substantial comparison to quantify the relative performance of both models.\n\n4. **Analysis & Improvement**: The last step involves a thorough analysis of the results from our comparison and evaluation. This may further lead to pinpointing areas within our model that need improvement and adjusting accordingly for optimal performance.\n\nThis research methodology provides a comprehensive approach, starting from proposing an innovative solution, testing it using real-world data, evaluating the performance, and iterating for improvement. This methodology is guided by the best research practices in computer science and natural language processing fields.'
