"METHOD:\n\n1. Subset kNN-MT: The proposed method aims to improve the decoding speed of k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (kNNMT) by retrieving neighbor target tokens from a subset of neighbor sentences of the input sentence. This reduces the search space and improves the efficiency of decoding. Additionally, an efficient distance computation technique using a look-up table is utilized for subset neighbor search. This approach significantly speeds up the decoding process, making it up to 132.2 times faster than standard kNNMT.\n\n2. Pre-training on large unlabeled corpora: Due to the lack of annotated addressee labels in multi-party dialogue datasets, it is challenging to pre-train a response generation model for multi-party dialogues. To overcome this data scarcity problem, previous works have focused on fine-tuning models on small datasets with annotated addressee labels. However, the proposed solution suggests utilizing large unlabeled corpora to pre-train a response generation model for multi-party dialogues. This leverages the success of pre-training large language models (PLMs) in general domains and applies it to multi-party dialogue response generation.\n\n3. Efficient datastore construction: In the kNN-MT method, a key-value translation memory, known as a datastore, is created. To improve the efficiency of datastore construction, a two-step approach is proposed. The first step involves creating the key-value translation memory, which stores pairs of D-dimensional vectors and tokens. The key represents the intermediate representation of the final decoder layer obtained from the source sentence and generated target tokens. The second step involves generation, where the output probability is calculated according to the nearest neighbors of the cached translation memory. This efficient datastore construction technique reduces the computational overhead and improves the overall efficiency of the translation process.\n\n4. Linear interpolation for output probabilities: During the generation process in kNN-MT, the output probabilities are computed by linearly interpolating between the kNN probabilities and the model prediction probabilities. This interpolation provides a balance between leveraging the information from the nearest neighbors and the model's own predictions. The hyperparameter lambda is introduced to control the weighting of the kNN probability. This approach ensures that both the kNN-based information and the model-based information are taken into account when generating the output probabilities.\n\n5. Speed-up techniques using look-up tables: To improve the efficiency of kNN-MT, the proposed method utilizes look-up tables for efficient distance computation. This technique allows for faster retrieval of neighbor tokens and reduces the computational overhead associated with distance calculations. By optimizing the distance computation process, the decoding speed of kNN-MT is significantly improved.\n\n6.

This allows for a thorough analysis of the hallucination problem and ensures the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results.\n\n7. Consistent taxonomy for hallucination detection: The proposed method adopts a consistent taxonomy for hallucination detection, which ensures comparability and consistency with previous work. By using a standardized classification system for hallucination types, the method provides clear and unambiguous annotations, making it easier to analyze and compare the effectiveness of different detection methods.\n\n8.

'METHOD: \n- Iterative Learning from User Feedback: The researchers design and deploy an iterative approach where information-seeking users ask questions, receive model-predicted answers, and provide feedback. This iterative process allows the extractive QA system to continually learn and improve over time based on user feedback.\n- Three-Option Feedback Signal: The researchers use a simple three-option feedback signal for users to provide feedback on the model\'s answers. The options include "correct," "partially correct," or "wrong."

This research aims to show that the model can rapidly improve even with limited feedback.\n- Different Approach to Human Feedback: Unlike existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods that rely on pair-wise comparisons from annotators, the researchers adopt a different approach by soliciting feedback from actual users on single outputs to their queries. This approach allows for a more practical interaction with users and facilitates the mapping of user feedback to reward values for contextual bandit learning.\n- Comparison with Other Approaches: The paper highlights that the choice of using single-output feedback from users instead of pair-wise comparisons is motivated by the suitability for soliciting feedback from actual users. The researchers also acknowledge the importance of comparing their approach to learning a reward model directly from feedback, as future work.\n- Previous Work on Learning from Feedback: The paper discusses previous work on learning from feedback for language tasks, including machine translation, semantic parsing, question answering, and chatbots. However, it emphasizes that previous work did not explore iterative continual learning, which is the focus of this research.\n- RL Using Human Feedback: The paper acknowledges previous work on RL using human feedback for non-language problems and mentions that RL from human feedback has also been studied for QA using synthetic interactions and simulated feedback.

'METHOD:\n\n1. Syntax-based Span Generation: One method to address the high computational cost and noise issues in span-based approaches is to leverage syntactic relations among aspect/opinion terms. This can involve analyzing the dependency parse tree of the sentence and identifying syntactically related words or phrases. By generating spans based on these syntactic relations, the search space of span candidates can be constrained, reducing the number of spans that need to be considered and improving efficiency.\n\n2. Part-of-Speech-based Span Generation: Another approach is to consider the part-of-speech characteristics of aspect/opinion terms when generating spans.
