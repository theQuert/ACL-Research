"1. Data Collection and Preparation: Collect high-quality documents from verified sources. In this case, we focus on sources supporting the 16 African Languages in consideration. Since the quality of the documents is crucial, additional measures to ensure their credibility and relevance are instituted. Special validators can be utilized to audit the document sources. \n\n2. Languages Supported Identification: This process involves identifying and grading the quality of languages supported by both the new dataset and the existing one that the new dataset is being compared with. This enables a better understanding of the improvements made in supporting low-resource languages.\n\n3. Pre-training using Multilingual T5: The next step involves pretraining a new T5-based Language Model (LM) on the collected dataset. This gives a general-purpose LM that can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n\n4. Model Evaluation: The final step involves evaluating the new model against the existing models. This includes benchmarking the new model's performance on multiple downstream tasks such as Cross-lingual QA evaluation, and comparing with previous models to highlight the improvements in model performance. \n\nPossible further improvements include expanding the data curation process to include more languages and diversifying the sources of documents to cover a wider scope of the languages. Also, continued refinement of the model's architecture can help improve its performance on downstream tasks."
