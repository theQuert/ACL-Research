'METHOD: Graph Decomposition and Augmentation with Contrastive Learning\n\n1. Graph Decomposition: To address the limitations of contrastively trained vision-language models in compositional reasoning, we propose a graph decomposition approach. We consider the scene graph parsed from text as a proxy for the image scene graph. By decomposing the scene graph into objects, their attributes, and relations, we can better understand the composition of the image and text.\n\n2. Graph Augmentation: Along with graph decomposition, we introduce a graph augmentation framework. This framework allows us to enhance the scene graph representation by adding additional information or modifying existing information. By augmenting the scene graph, we can improve attribute binding and relation understanding.\n\n3. Coarse-to-Fine Contrastive Learning: We propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning objective between images and text. This objective aligns sentences of various complexities to the same image, allowing the model to learn the relationships between objects, attributes, and relations in a more systematic manner. By training the model to understand complex sentences and their corresponding images, we can improve its compositional reasoning abilities.\n\n4. Negative Mining in Scene Graph Space: We introduce novel negative mining techniques in the scene graph space. By carefully selecting negative examples from the scene graph, we can improve attribute binding and relation understanding. This negative mining process helps the model to differentiate between correct and incorrect compositions, enhancing its compositional reasoning abilities.\n\nThrough extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving attribute binding, relation understanding, systematic generalization, and productivity. Our method shows significant improvements over strong baselines, achieving similar or better performance than existing vision-language models like CLIP on various multimodal tasks.'
