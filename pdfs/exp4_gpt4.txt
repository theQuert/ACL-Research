'### METHOD:\n\nThe substantial problem identified in the abstract and related work sections pertains to the toxicity of machine-generated language. Notably, prior studies establish that large, pre-trained language models can generate toxic and biased language. The solutions proposed thus concern detoxification methods, and in particular, ability to control or steer text generation.\n\n(i) **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-Decoding**: The main identified method for resolving toxicity is MIL-Decoding. This approach involves the use of a MIL model trained on a toxicity labeled corpus to predict the overall toxicity. Rather than filtering out specific words which proves insufficient, the MIL-Decoding operates at a token-level that takes into account contextual information. This way, it enables effective control over text generation, specifically targetting toxic elements in the generated language.\n\n(ii) **Pre-fix Tuning**: An alternative method identified from the past studies is the use of pre-fix tuning. Pre-fix tuning enables the steering of text generation by using a controlled prefix in the process of text generation. This method could be improvised and used alongside MIL-Decoding to increase efficiency in controlling toxicity.\n\n(iii) **Toxicity Control Codes**: Control codes can guide language models to generate language with desired attributes by modeling an attribute variable. The control codes can therefore be used to direct language models away from generating toxic language.\n\n(iv) **External Expert Knowledge Integration**: External expert knowledge , as suggested in the related work, can be incorporated to provide insights about toxicity in language models. By integrating this into MIL-Decoding, more accurate detoxification can be achieved.\n\n(v) **Weighted Decoding at the Inference Stage**: Another approach to alleviating toxicity in language models is by utilising weighted decoding at the inference stage. This method manipulates the output distribution without modifying the original pre-trained language model. This can supplement MIL-Decoding to achieve effective detoxification.\n\nIt is of worth noting that solutions must strive for a balance between detoxification effectiveness and language model quality. It is also key to address any bias against marginalized groups that may be exacerbated by the detoxification methods. Consequently, a comprehensive solution should integrate several of the methods identified to ensure this balance is maintained.'
