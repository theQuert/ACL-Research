'### METHOD:\n\nOur proposed experimentation method consists of several stages. \n\n1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: We use two primary datasets; first is the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge Dataset with over 200k comments labeled as being toxic. The second is the RealToxicityPrompts and a QA-dataset provided by Solaiman and Dennison. The datasets are preprocessed to extract toxicity labels for each text.\n\n2. **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) Model Training**: MIL, traditionally used in scenarios where class labels are associated with collection of instances rather than individual instances, is leveraged to predict toxicity labels. We first train an MIL model on our preprocessed datasets. Our MIL model aims to predict both the overall toxicity of a text and the toxicity of individual tokens in context. \n\n3. **Introduction of the MIL-Decoding Framework**: We propagate the trained MIL model into a new architecture called MIL-Decoding. This proposed method uses the trained MIL model to compute a toxicity distribution over the next potential generated tokens. \n\n4. **Evaluation of the Model**: We evaluate the performance of our proposed MIL-Decoding using automated metrics. We will also carry out human evaluation to assess the practicability of the model in the real world scenarios.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis**: We then analyze and compare the performance of our proposed method with other traditional approaches like filtering out specific wordlist at the decoding stage etc. \n\n6. **Evaluation of Biases and Ethical Concerns**: Lastly, we pay attention on how our method produces detoxified text and monitor it for exacerbating bias against marginalized groups, an issue highlighted in the previous research. We evaluate its potential effects using the TOXIGEN dataset and leveraging external expert knowledge as per the methods of Sridhar and Yang. \n\nOverall, our method seeks to not just consider the individual instances of toxic text, but to consider the wider context when generating content to minimize toxicity.'
