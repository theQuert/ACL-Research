"### RESEARCH METHOD:\n\nGiven the abstract and related work, it seems the research method follows these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem:** The researchers identify the problem of generating dialogue responses in multi-party dialogues. They highlight the need to specify the addressee of a response utterance before the response is generated, unlike two-party dialogues. They also mention the issue of the scarcity of labelled data in multi-party dialogues, which makes pre-training a dialogue response generation model difficult.\n\n2. **Theoretical Analysis and Construction of the Model:** The authors propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework to address the scarcity of labelled data. They theoretically justify this method's feasibility and effectiveness, presumably constructing mathematical models or similar theoretical proof to validate this methodology.\n\n3. **Iterative Implementation:** The EM approach involves an iterative process that alternates between performing the expectation steps (generating addressee labels) and the maximization steps (optimizing a dialogue response generation model). \n\n4. **Study of Existing Models:** As indicated in the related work, the authors study existing two-party dialogue models such as DialoGPT, PLATO, and DialogVED, and multi-party dialogue models like the GSN model proposed by Hu et al. (2019) and the HeterMPC model by Gu et al. (2022). This helps them understand current methodologies and identify areas of improvement or differentiation in their approach.\n\n5. **Experimental Evaluation:** Finally, the researchers validate their proposed method through extensive experimentation. While the specific experimental design is not mentioned in the abstract, it likely involves comparing their model's performance to existing models using standard metrics. It might also include a demonstration of how the method can be applied to multi-party dialogues and how it improves response generation."
