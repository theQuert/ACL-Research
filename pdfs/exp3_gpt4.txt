'### METHOD: \n\nFrom the discussions in the abstract and the related work, there are a few potential solutions that can be applied to mitigate the described drawbacks. \n\n1. **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Approach**: As mentioned in the abstract, an EM approach that operates in an iterative manner can be employed. This solution revolves around performing expectation steps to generate addressee labels, and taking maximization steps to optimize the response generation model. This would help alleviate the problem of lack of annotated addressee labels in multi-party dialogue datasets.\n\n2. **Utilise Larger Unlabeled Datasets**: Rather than restricting the learning process within small datasets with explicit addressee labels, you can benefit from employing larger unlabeled dialogue corpora. Specifically, you can pre-train a response generation model on these larger datasets, and then fine-tune it on the smaller, labeled datasets for multi-party dialogue response generation. \n\n3. **Implementing a Tree-structured Dialogue History**: Instead of the conventional sequential dialogue history, a tree-structured dialogue history can be implemented. This structure can better capture the nature of multi-party dialogues where an agent can respond to any preceding utterance.\n\n4. **Latent Variables with Actual Meanings**: Use latent variables with actual meanings as this could provide a more precise framework for navigating multi-party dialogues. The variable zt = j being indicative of the addressee of the response at the t th turn being the j th utterance greatly reduces the ambiguity inherent in multi-party dialogues.\n\n5. **HybridModels Using GNNs and Transformers**: Models like Graph Structured Neural Network (GSN) and HeterMPC have been proposed to encode the dialogue history. These models use Graph Neural Networks as well as Transformers for encoding the dialogue history and then use cross attention or transformer decoders for generating responses. Integration of such hybrid models might improve the efficiency of multi-party dialogue response generation. \n\nBy adopting these solutions, it would be viable to create a more robust and effective dialogue generation system that can handle multi-party dialogues effectively.'
