"METHOD: \n\nTo address the latent disadvantages in the given abstract and related work, the following feasible solutions can be implemented:\n\n1. Data Quality Auditing: Conduct a meticulous audit of existing pretraining corpora to identify and rectify prevalent quality issues, particularly in the context of low-resource languages. This can involve examining sources, verifying credibility, and ensuring that data is from clean and reliable sources such as news domains. By enhancing the quality of the pretraining data, the overall performance and downstream effectiveness of the language models can be improved.\n\n2. Indigenous Language Resources: Foster indigenous efforts to build language resources specifically for African languages. This can involve creating small high-quality datasets (e.g., 1GB) sourced from verified and clean sources. By focusing on quality rather than quantity, these resources can provide a reliable foundation for pretraining models in low-resource scenarios.\n\n3. Multilingual Pretraining Corpus: Develop a new multilingual pretraining corpus specifically tailored for 16 African languages. This corpus should be designed by carefully auditing existing pretraining data sources, such as large-scale web crawls and document-level datasets. By improving the quality of these corpora through meticulous source auditing (e.g., base URLs), the effectiveness of the pretraining process can be enhanced.\n\n4. Performance Benchmarking: Pretrain a new T5-based language model using the curated dataset and evaluate its performance on multiple downstream tasks. This can include evaluating the model's effectiveness on cross-lingual QA tasks and comparing it against existing multilingual models such as mBERT. By demonstrating superior performance and effectiveness on these tasks, the importance of data quality in pretraining language models for low-resource scenarios can be underscored.\n\nBy implementing these methods, the study aims to address the latent disadvantages associated with data quality issues in pretraining multilingual language models, particularly in the context of African languages."
