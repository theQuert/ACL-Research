'Given the abstract and related work, a suitable research method for this paper could be as follows:\n\n1. Data Collection: Collect a large corpus of text data that includes both toxic and non-toxic examples. This corpus can be used to train the MIL model and evaluate the MIL-Decoding approach.\n\n2. MIL Model Training: Train a multiple instance learning (MIL) network on the collected corpus. The MIL model should be trained to predict the overall toxicity of a text as well as the toxicity of each token in its context. This will involve designing an appropriate architecture for the MIL network and training it using suitable optimization algorithms.\n\n3. MIL-Decoding: Develop the MIL-Decoding approach, which uses the trained MIL network to detoxify language models at the token-level. The MIL-Decoding approach should interpolate the output of the original language model with the toxicity distribution computed by the MIL network. This interpolation should be performed in a way that avoids toxicity in the generated text.\n\n4. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the MIL-Decoding approach using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The automatic metrics can include measures of toxicity, generation fluency, and other relevant factors. The human evaluation can involve soliciting ratings and feedback from human judges on the quality and toxicity of the generated text.\n\n5. Comparison with Baselines: Compare the performance of the MIL-Decoding approach with other baselines that have been proposed for detoxifying language models. This can include methods based on control codes, prefix-tuning, weighted decoding, and other related techniques. The comparison should highlight the advantages and limitations of the MIL-Decoding approach.\n\n6. Experimentation: Conduct experiments conditioned on two widely-used datasets, RealToxicityPrompts and a QA-dataset provided by Solaiman and Dennison. This experimentation should involve generating text using the MIL-Decoding approach and comparing it with the baselines using the selected datasets. The experimentation can also explore the impact of different hyperparameters and variations of the MIL-Decoding approach.\n\n7. Analysis and Discussion: Analyze the results of the experiments and discuss the findings in relation to the research objectives. This analysis should highlight the effectiveness of the MIL-Decoding approach in detoxifying language models and its impact on generation fluency. It should also discuss the trade-off between detoxification effectiveness and language model quality, as well as the risks of exacerbating bias against marginalized groups.\n\n8. Conclusion and Future Work: Summarize the key findings of the research and discuss potential avenues for future work. This can include further improvements to the MIL-Decoding approach, exploration of different architectures for MIL networks, and investigation of other strategies for detoxifying language models.'
