'### METHOD:\n\nTo alleviate the issues involved in the current pretraining data and resultant language models, we propose an approach of rigorous auditing and rectification of quality issues in the multilingual pretraining corpora. \n\n1. **Quality Corpus Construction**: We aim to construct a high quality corpus tailored to African languages by robust auditing of existing pretraining corpora to identify and rectify prevalent quality issues. We will follow similar principles as mentioned by (Ogueji et al., 2021), i.e., annotating high-quality data from clean or verified sources, while also increasing the scale of our datasets. \n\n2. **Dataset Enhancement**: To do this we will inspect the contributing URLs in large-scale web crawls, and specifically audit base URLs (like www.voahausa.com) by filtering out low-quality or irrelevant sources. This will ensure high relevance and quality of the documents included in the corpus.\n\n3. **Model Training**: Once the quality corpus is constructed for the 16 African Languages, we will pretrain a T5-based LM on this enhanced dataset.\n\n4. **Transfer Learning**: The model will be further fine-tuned on multiple downstream Natural Language Processing tasks such as Machine Translation, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, and Semantic Textual Similarity by leveraging transfer learning techniques. \n\n5. **Cross-lingual Evaluation**: We will evaluate the developed models with the help of cross-lingual QA evaluation along with other standard evaluation metrics to measure their performance. The ultimate goal is to significantly improve the effectiveness (more than twice as the multilingual T5) in low-resource scenarios that adopt African languages. \n\nThis methodology is aiming to balance the trade-off between quantity and quality of data used for pretraining language models by focusing on curated corpus specifically for African languages. It also highlights the necessary attention required for auditing base URLs to filter high-quality data in building any language resource, especially for low-resource languages.'
