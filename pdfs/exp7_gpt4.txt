'### METHOD for Abstract and Related Work 1\n\n\nFor the problem stated in the abstract, a possible solution could be the development of a self-refining model that aggregates feedback from both internal and external sources to progressively improve upon hallucination errors. For the internal source, the model could be designed to retrain itself by harnessing the sequence log-probabilities discovered to outperform standard hallucination detection methods. For the external part, quality evaluation metrics, heuristics or uncertainty detectors from previous studies could be systematically applied within a preference learning framework to assess and refine the accuracy of translated outputs. \n\nTo address the challenges highlighted in the related work, a deep learning-based approach could be adopted that would incorporate the best of Transformer and Fairseq hyperparameters. Exploring the pathologies of translation and hallucination with a keen focus on erroneous repetitions of words, phrases, and incorrect translations would be integral to refining the model. The method could also involve a dynamic adjustment framework that identifies and corrects the severity of a hallucination to ensure that the translated content is in alignment with the source material.\n\n### METHOD for Abstract and Related Work 2\n\n\nFor multi-party dialog response generation as described in the second Abstract and Related Work, semantic coherence and context preservation model could be proposed. This model should be able to maintain the identities of all interacting parties and understand their conversational roles in generating responses. The solution could harness the advantage of pre-training large language models (PLMs) on huge corpora of two-party dialogs and then fine-tune these PLMs on smaller, annotated multi-party dialogue datasets.\n\nTaking a hint from the related work, the proposed solution may involve the use of Graph Structured Neural Networks (GSN) for dialogue modelling. In this setup, each utterance in a dialogue is treated as a node and the addressee relations are treated as edges. The relations are then encoded using Transformers, thus enabling a model that can generate tailored responses to each addressee in the multi-party dialogue.\n\n### METHOD for Abstract and Related Work 3\n\nTo continually improve an extractive question answering (QA) system as mentioned in the third Abstract and Related Work, a continual machine-learning reinforcement approach could be employed. The proposed model would rely on both direct and indirect feedback from the users, where positive feedback will lead to reinforcing the strategies and techniques used in providing the given answer, while negative feedback will lead to the modification of these strategies and techniques. \n\nTo address the related work, the proposed method will utilize reinforcement and reward systems in Offline Contextual Bandit Learning. This approach will map single output responses to corresponding reward values, thereby motivating the NLP system to improve. The proposed model will also adopt a comparative analysis approach, where the output of human feedback and reward models are frequently compared, to continually improve existing processes and methods. Future directions could involve devising more intuitive and simplified methods for obtaining feedback from users, such as seamless integration of feedback collection mechanisms into the user interface (UI) without disrupting their experience.'
