'### METHOD:\n\nGiven the challenges identified in the abstract and related work on generating diverse, answerable questions from a given context, the proposed solution or method would tackle these by introducing an optimized question generation and validation model.\n\n1. **Expansive Question Generation**: Using a transformer model architecture, which benefits from long-range dependencies in the text and a hierarchy of self-attention layers, diverse questions would be generated from a given context. Pre-processing techniques could involve an initial text segmentation approach to break the context down into manageable chunks, ensuring the variety and diversity of the generated questions.\n\n2. **Maximum Question Similarity Loss Training**: To ensure that the questions generated are contextually appropriate, we would propose a novel training technique called Maximum Question Similarity Loss (MQSL). MQSL would work by rewarding the model when it generates questions that are semantically similar to the provided context, and penalize it when the questions deviate. This would result in context-appropriate and diverse questions.\n\n3. **Answerability Evaluation Model**: After generating the questions, classifying their answerability is a vital step. An auxiliary classification model, pre-trained on a comprehensive question answering dataset like SQuAD2.0, would be used here. This model would categorize the generated questions into: explicit (those that can be directly answered with the provided context), implicit (those needing inference from the context), and non-answerable.\n\n4. **Transformative Sampling Techniques**: To encourage the generation of varied questions, and not just the most probable ones, a combination of top-k sampling and nucleus sampling should be utilized. This allows the model to randomly sample from the top "k" possible next words, encouraging diversity and diminishing predicted repetitions.\n\n5. **Evaluation Matrix**: Lastly, the performance of the method would be evaluated by integrating standard score metrics and diversity metrics, and applying these to a range of QA datasets to ensure validity and reliability. \n\nThis proposed method, if applied, has the potential to provide a more robust, context-appropriate, and diverse array of generated answerable questions from given text. This would, in turn, enhance the overall efficacy of QG systems, making them more suitable for various applications including education and conversational systems.'
