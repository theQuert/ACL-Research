"1) Dialogue History Embedding: For each dialogue, mark each utterance with its turn and speaker and extract its content as input. Compose a positional embedding system to account for the possibly complex dialogue history. \n\n2) Addressee Prediction Module: Predict the addressee of the next utterance using the dialogue history embedding. This can be implemented using a multiclass classification approach, with each class representing a potential speaker in the dialogue. \n\n3) Response Generation Module: Generate the response based on the dialogue history embedding and the predicted addressee. This response needs to be coherent and relevant to the conversation. A typical encoder-decoder architecture can be used for this stage. \n\n4) Fine-tuning and Evaluation: Fine-tune the model on a large multi-party dialogue corpus. After the model is fine-tuned, evaluate the model's performance using standard dialogue evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores. \n\n5) Iterative EM Updating: Initialize the EM approach using known labelled data. In the E-step, predict on the full corpus to derive soft labels. In the M-step, use the expected labels to retrain the model. Continue iteratively until convergence, with the final parameters determined as the maximization or distribution of expected labels. \n\nThese methods aim to address the challenges in multi-party dialogue response generation by predicting potential speakers (addressees) in the conversation and generating relevant responses. Distributing the data in an iterative way allows the latent structure of conversations to emerge. The approach is supported by a theoretically and data-driven construction of the dialogue history embeddings, which incorporate important characteristics such as speaker and dialogue turns. This can improve the coherence and relevancy of the translated dialogue responses, even in complex or multi-party dialogues."
