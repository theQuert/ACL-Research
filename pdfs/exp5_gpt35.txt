"METHOD:\n\n1. Subset kNN-MT: The proposed method aims to improve the decoding speed of k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (kNNMT) by retrieving neighbor target tokens from a subset of neighbor sentences of the input sentence. This reduces the search space and improves the efficiency of decoding. Additionally, an efficient distance computation technique using a look-up table is utilized for subset neighbor search. This approach significantly speeds up the decoding process, making it up to 132.2 times faster than standard kNNMT.\n\n2. Pre-training on large unlabeled corpora: Due to the lack of annotated addressee labels in multi-party dialogue datasets, it is challenging to pre-train a response generation model for multi-party dialogues. To overcome this data scarcity problem, previous works have focused on fine-tuning models on small datasets with annotated addressee labels. However, the proposed solution suggests utilizing large unlabeled corpora to pre-train a response generation model for multi-party dialogues. This leverages the success of pre-training large language models (PLMs) in general domains and applies it to multi-party dialogue response generation.\n\n3. Efficient datastore construction: In the kNN-MT method, a key-value translation memory, known as a datastore, is created. To improve the efficiency of datastore construction, a two-step approach is proposed. The first step involves creating the key-value translation memory, which stores pairs of D-dimensional vectors and tokens. The key represents the intermediate representation of the final decoder layer obtained from the source sentence and generated target tokens. The second step involves generation, where the output probability is calculated according to the nearest neighbors of the cached translation memory. This efficient datastore construction technique reduces the computational overhead and improves the overall efficiency of the translation process.\n\n4. Linear interpolation for output probabilities: During the generation process in kNN-MT, the output probabilities are computed by linearly interpolating between the kNN probabilities and the model prediction probabilities. This interpolation provides a balance between leveraging the information from the nearest neighbors and the model's own predictions. The hyperparameter lambda is introduced to control the weighting of the kNN probability. This approach ensures that both the kNN-based information and the model-based information are taken into account when generating the output probabilities.\n\n5. Speed-up techniques using look-up tables: To improve the efficiency of kNN-MT, the proposed method utilizes look-up tables for efficient distance computation. This technique allows for faster retrieval of neighbor tokens and reduces the computational overhead associated with distance calculations. By optimizing the distance computation process, the decoding speed of kNN-MT is significantly improved.\n\n6. Clean dataset for evaluation: The evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation methods in natural language processing requires a clean dataset with annotated translations and the model that produced them. The proposed method utilizes a large dataset of annotated translations, along with a model trained on a specific set of sentence pairs. This allows for a thorough analysis of the hallucination problem and ensures the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results.\n\n7. Consistent taxonomy for hallucination detection: The proposed method adopts a consistent taxonomy for hallucination detection, which ensures comparability and consistency with previous work. By using a standardized classification system for hallucination types, the method provides clear and unambiguous annotations, making it easier to analyze and compare the effectiveness of different detection methods.\n\n8. Improved detection accuracy: The method emphasizes the importance of considering internal model characteristics in hallucination detection. By leveraging the information contained within the translation model itself, the proposed method improves the detection accuracy for severe hallucinations by a factor of 2. This demonstrates that internal model characteristics can provide valuable insights and can be used as a standalone approach for detecting hallucinations.\n\n9. Alleviation of hallucinations at test time: The proposed method also focuses on alleviating hallucinations at test time. By incorporating external tools and measures, the method is able to alleviate hallucinations to a similar extent as the previous best approach that heavily relies on external models. This indicates that a combination of internal model characteristics and external tools can effectively address the challenge of hallucination in machine translation.\n\n10. Release of code and experiments: To contribute to the research community and promote reproducibility, the proposed method includes the release of the code used in the experiments. This allows other researchers to reproduce the results and further explore the effectiveness of the method. By sharing the code and experimental details, the proposed method fosters collaboration and facilitates advancements in the field of natural language processing."
