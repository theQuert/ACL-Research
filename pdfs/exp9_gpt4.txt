'### METHOD:\n\nTo address the latent disadvantages inherent in the issues of high computational cost and excessive noise in span-based methods for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE), we propose a synergistic combination of syntactic and semantic annotation-based span generation. This approach would serve to filter out generated spans to reduce unnecessary computational strain. \n\nFor computational efficiency, we plan to implement an innovative span pruning algorithm, which is based on lexical and grammatical rules obtained from respective datasets. This algorithm would abstract away spans that do not conform to these rules, thereby decreasing the number of spans to be processed. \n\nTo tackle the problem of noise, we suggest the utilization of dependency parsing to extract only relevant spans. As per our design, a span would be retained only if its component words have a direct grammatical relation as depicted in the parse tree of the sentence. This would significantly reduce the noise, as it would eliminate spans that are not grammatically cohesive. \n\nAdditionally, we plan to implement an iterative fine-tuning process, whereby spans are generated and pruned in multiple iterations, with each iteration learning from the mistakes of its predecessor, and further reducing the processing unnecessary spans.\n\nFinally, we believe an enhanced span-level interaction model could further improve the efficiency and accuracy of the ASTE task. Taking the interaction between the syntactic and part-of-speech views into account would provide valuable linguistic information into learned span representations, which could effectively aid in sentiment identification. \n\nIt is our assertion that this method—merging span pruning algorithms, dependency parsing, iterative fine-tuning, and an enhanced span-level interaction model—would not only resolve the aforementioned issues in span-based ASTE methods, but also set a benchmark for future developments in this field.'
