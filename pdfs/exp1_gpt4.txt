'METHOD:\n\nThe optimization challenges, emphasizing on the parameters and output space of the networks, can be overcome by implementing advanced optimization techniques. Algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) can be exploited to smoothen the learning process of network parameters. More advanced or specialized algorithms, evolved for binary or ternary neural networks, can also be exercised.\n\nTo tackle the sensitivity of the attention operation to quantization and the noise-compounding effects of autoregressive decoding, potential solutions can include various noise-filtering techniques, such as statistical noise reduction or the implementation of Denoising Autoencoders. Working in the direction of incorporating noise robustness in the learning phase of the model could play a significant role in countering these disadvantages.\n\nIn general, to further increment the efficiency and performance of binary and ternary models, a probable solution could be to experiment and work with hybrid models. This includes disposing of reduced precision models with some full-precision components or layers, wherever necessary and possible to uphold the balance between model performance and computational efficiency.\n\nLast, but not the least, valuable insights and methodologies can be extracted from the existing works that have managed to implement transformation of neural networks and have achieved success in quantization of models. This could involve integrating their techniques in our network model or molding their methods to best suit our architecture, thereby improvising them and helping us to develop an edge over others.\n\nSuch an assemblage of methods could potentially provide a significant push in overcoming the unexplored constraints or limitations faced by ternary and binary neural networks in transformer text generation models. Time and resource-demanding full-precision computations could be strategically reduced, thus enhancing network efficiency with just a bit of compromise on the accuracy side.'
