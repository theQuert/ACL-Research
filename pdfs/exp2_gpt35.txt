"Based on the abstract and related work, a suitable research method for addressing hallucinations in neural machine translation could be as follows:\n\n1. Dataset Preparation: Utilize the annotated dataset released by Guerreiro et al. (2022), which contains fine-grained manual annotations of 3415 German-to-English translations. This dataset consists of examples categorized as hallucinations, less severe translation errors, and correct translations.\n\n2. Model Evaluation: Use the Transformer base model from fairseq, trained on the WMT'18 German-English news translation data, excluding Paracrawl. Evaluate the model's performance on the annotated dataset by measuring its capability to generate hallucinations.\n\n3. Internal Model Characteristics: Investigate the internal characteristics of the translation model itself as a means to detect and alleviate hallucinations. Specifically, propose a method that evaluates the percentage of the source contribution to a generated translation. Hallucinations are expected to have low source contribution, as they are translations detached from the source. Measure the detection accuracy of this method and compare it against existing detection approaches.\n\n4. External Tools Integration: If required, explore the use of external tools to further improve hallucination detection and mitigation. Consider utilizing sentence similarity from cross-lingual embeddings as an external measure. Evaluate the impact of incorporating these external measures on the accuracy of hallucination detection and the ability to alleviate hallucinations at test time.\n\n5. Comparative Analysis: Compare the performance of the proposed method (internal model characteristics-based) with existing methods that rely on external models, such as neural quality estimation systems and uncertainty detectors. Assess the effectiveness of each approach in detecting and mitigating hallucinations.\n\n6. Code Release: Release the code of the experiments to contribute to the research community and enable replication of the proposed method and the evaluation framework used.\n\nBy following these steps, the research study can contribute to the advancement of the field by providing insights into hallucination detection and mitigation approaches, evaluating the effectiveness of internal model characteristics, exploring the integration of external measures, and providing a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework for future research."
