'Method:\n- Explore the use of internal model characteristics: Investigate the extent to which the translation model itself can provide information on hallucinations without relying on external models or measures. This approach has shown promising results in improving detection accuracy for severe hallucinations. Further research can be conducted to understand and leverage the internal characteristics of the model to alleviate hallucinations.\n\n- Develop improved detection methods: While existing detection methods fall short in identifying hallucinations, the observation that the standard sequence log-probability is informative suggests the need for more effective detection methods. Researchers can explore novel approaches and techniques specifically targeted at hallucination detection, considering both the internal model characteristics and external tools.\n\n- Investigate external tools for evaluation: Previous work has mainly focused on using string-based methods or neural quality estimation systems to automatically evaluate the quality of translation examples. To further enhance hallucination detection, researchers can explore the potential of other external tools and measures that can provide valuable insights and metrics for evaluating translation outputs.\n\n- Establish a canonical hallucination taxonomy: The lack of a standardized hallucination taxonomy poses a challenge in comparing and interpreting results across different studies. Establishing a canonical hallucination taxonomy, as done by Guerreiro et al. (2022), can provide consistency in evaluating and categorizing hallucination errors. This taxonomy can serve as a reference for future research and facilitate the development of more targeted methods for hallucination detection and mitigation.\n\n- Release datasets and code: To promote reproducibility and facilitate further research in the field, it is essential to release datasets and code. The dataset provided by Guerreiro et al. (2022) has been widely used to analyze hallucinations in a clean setting, and sharing such resources can encourage the development of new methods and techniques for hallucination detection and mitigation. Researchers should consider releasing their experimental code and datasets to foster collaboration and accelerate progress in the field.'
