'### METHOD:\n\nThe main focus of our proposed method is to alleviate the difficulty of optimizing Binary and Ternary Neural Networks (BNNs and TNNs) in transformer-based text generation models. Our approach to optimize BNN and TNN involves the following steps:\n\n**1. Training Robust BNNs and TNNs using Strong Regularization Techniques:**\n\nGiven the sensitivity of attention operation to quantization and the noise-compounding effects of autoregressive decoding, we propose to utilize strong regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping in order to train robust ternary/binary models that are robust to the mentioned challenges.\n\n**2. Novel Quantization Scheme:**\n\nWe propose a novel quantization scheme to ameliorate the effects of highly discretized parameter and output space that these networks operate in. For instance, we could explore non-uniform or adaptive quantization schemes that could potentially yield better performance.\n\n**3. Leveraging Efficient Hardware:**\n\nOur method would circumvent the mentioned challenges by implementing these quantized models on specialized hardware, which is commoditized for binary/ternary operations. This would grant us significant efficiency gains when compared to full-precision networks, without sacrificing much in terms of model performance.\n\n**4. Parameter Noise Injection:**\n\nWe could also experiment injecting noise into the parameters during training (e.g., Binary Dropout (Courbariaux & Bengio, 2016)) to improve the robustness and generalization of BNNs and TNNs.\n\n**5. Attention Mechanism Optimization:**\n\nWe propose to devise a modified attention operation more resistant to quantization, or to introduce relative position encodings (Shaw et al., 2018) in the Transformer model to reduce its reliance on precision for optimal performance.\n\n**6. High-Cardinality Output Space Management:**\n\nManaging high-cardinality output space could be achieved via techniques like hierarchical softmax or splitting the output vocabulary into more manageable chunks and training separate transformers for each chunk.\n\n**7. Knowledge Distillation:**\n\nWe also would consider knowledge distillation from a full-precision model to a binary/ternary model as a potential way to mitigate the weaknesses mentioned.\n\nThis proposed method offers a promising solution for the challenges impending the optimization of BNNs and TNNs when implementing transformer-based text generation models. Moreover, through continuous research and testing, this approach is adaptable and can be further tailored to deal with any other discovered complications in the future.\n'
