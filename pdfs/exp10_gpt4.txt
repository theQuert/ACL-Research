"### METHOD:\n\nGiven the challenges identified in the abstract and related work sections regarding contrastively trained vision-language models and their struggle with compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and relations, a multi-step method approach to address these could entail:\n\n1. **Creating Fine-grained Scene Graphs:** To address the identified limitation of models in handling compositional reasoning, we could introduce a comprehensive scene graph creation process. Each image would be parsed to create a scene graph that includes all the underlying objects, their attributes, and the relations between them. For text representation, natural language processing techniques can be used to build text-scene graphs. Beyond just objects, these graphs should also analyze and incorporate color, size, location, and other attribute information for comprehensive understanding. \n\n2. **Contrastive Learning with Fine-grained Scene Graphs**: Utilize the created scene graphs for a more detailed contrastive learning process between images and text. This learning process aligns sentences with various semantic complexities and their corresponding part of the scene graph. This could potentially help the model to bind correct attributes to the correct objects and more accurately understand relations. \n\n3. **Graph Decomposition and Augmentation:** Decompose the graph into smaller sections, each containing an object and its related information. Apply data augmentation techniques on these subsections to create more training examples. This data augmentation would increase the model's exposure to varied instances of object-attribute relationships and relations between objects.\n\n4. **Coarse-to-Fine Contrastive Learning Strategy:** Implement a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning strategy. Start the training by showing the model images and corresponding coarse descriptions, gradually moving towards more detailed ones as training progresses. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize and understand more complex sentences.\n\n5. **Focused Negative Mining:** Introduce a negative mining technique which exclusively focuses on incorrectly identified relations and attributes in the scene graph. By specifically formulating negative samples from these hard-to-learn instances, the model can be directed to improve its performance in weaker areas, thereby significantly improving its attribute binding, relation understanding, and overall performance."
