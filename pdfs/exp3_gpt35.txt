'Given the abstract and related work provided, a suitable research method for this paper could be as follows:\n\n1. Data Collection: Gather multi-party dialogue datasets without annotated addressee labels. This could involve scraping online conversation platforms or utilizing existing conversation datasets.\n\n2. Pre-training of Language Models: Utilize the collected datasets to pre-train large language models (PLMs) for multi-party dialogue response generation. This could involve adapting existing pre-training methods used for two-party dialogue response generation.\n\n3. Expectation-Maximization (EM) Approach: Propose an EM approach that iteratively performs expectation steps to generate addressee labels and maximization steps to optimize the response generation model. This approach would address the lack of annotated addressee labels in multi-party dialogue datasets. The theoretical analyses and extensive experiments conducted should justify the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed method.\n\n4. Implementation and Evaluation: Implement the proposed EM approach and evaluate its performance on the collected multi-party dialogue datasets. This could involve measuring metrics such as response quality, coherence, and addressee accuracy.\n\n5. Comparison with Existing Approaches: Compare the performance of the proposed method with existing approaches for multi-party dialogue response generation, such as GSN (Graph Structured Neural Network) and HeterMPC (Heterogeneous Multi-Party Conversations). Highlight the advantages and limitations of the proposed method in terms of scalability, data scarcity, and effectiveness.\n\n6. Discussion and Conclusion: Discuss the findings of the experiments and the implications of the proposed method. Provide insights into future directions for improving multi-party dialogue response generation.\n\nOverall, this research method aims to address the challenge of generating responses in multi-party dialogues by proposing an EM approach that utilizes large unlabeled corpora and pre-training of PLMs. The method should provide a solution for the lack of annotated addressee labels in multi-party dialogue datasets and demonstrate improved performance compared to existing approaches.'
