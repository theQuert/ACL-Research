'METHOD: \n\n1. **Enhancing Diversity in Question Generation**: One solution to enhance the diversity of generated questions is to incorporate techniques such as top-k sampling and nucleus sampling during the decoding process. These techniques can encourage the model to explore less likely vocabularies and produce more diverse outputs. By sampling tokens from a larger vocabulary, the model can generate questions with different phrasing, structure, and content, leading to a wider variety of questions.\n\n2. **Measuring Question Diversity**: To measure the diversity of generated questions, a novel evaluation metric can be developed. This metric can take into account various factors such as semantic similarity, syntactic variation, and topic coverage. By quantitatively evaluating the diversity of questions, researchers can compare different models and techniques, identifying which approaches are more successful in generating diverse sets of questions.\n\n3. **Adapting Pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for Multi-Question Generation**: Pre-trained LMs have proven to be effective in question generation tasks. To address the challenge of generating multiple questions, pre-trained LMs can be fine-tuned specifically for multi-question generation. By modifying the training objective and incorporating techniques to encourage diversity, the LM can be optimized to generate a comprehensive set of questions based on a given context.\n\n4. **Evaluation of Answerability**: To validate the answerability of generated questions, an evaluation model can be developed. This model can classify questions as either answerable or non-answerable by utilizing existing question answering models or by introducing new criteria. By assessing the answerability of questions, it becomes possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the question generation model and make improvements accordingly.\n\n5. **Training on Diverse Dataset**: To improve the diversity of generated questions, the question generation model can be trained on a diverse dataset. This dataset can include questions from a wide range of domains, topics, and contexts. By exposing the model to a variety of question styles and content, it can learn to generate more diverse and contextually relevant questions.\n\n6. **Recursive Referencing Process**: To generate a wider array of questions while preserving semantic correctness, a recursive referencing process can be employed. This process involves referencing questions from the same context and using them as a source of inspiration for generating new questions. By incorporating this referencing mechanism, the model can generate questions that are not only diverse but also contextually relevant and coherent.\n\nOverall, these proposed methods aim to address the latent disadvantages in question generation, such as the lack of question diversity and the difficulty in measuring answerability. By enhancing the diversity of generated questions and developing evaluation metrics to assess answerability, researchers can improve the effectiveness and reliability of question generation models.'
