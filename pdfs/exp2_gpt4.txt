'### METHOD:\n\nTo effectively tackle the challenge of hallucinations in neural machine translation, the following methods could be implemented:\n1. **Enhancing internal model characteristics**: According to the abstract, internal model characteristics have proven to be extremely beneficial in detecting and reducing hallucinations. Therefore, efforts should be concentrated towards comprehension and improvement of these intrinsic aspects of the neural models which could involve training procedures, architecture enhancements, and leveraging internal probabilistic estimates better.\n2. **Employing external tools effectively**: While this research seems to be focusing primarily on the capabilities of the model alone, incorporation of external tools and measures still holds potential. String-based methods or neural quality estimation systems could be used in innovative ways to assess the quality of translation and to mitigate hallucination issues in them.\n3. **Augmented training data**: The hallucination detection and mitigation methods used rely on a dataset comprising 5.8 M sentence pairs for training. Applying data augmentation techniques, such as translation and back-translation, or synthesizing hallucination instances, could help the model improve its hallucination detection and correction capabilities.\n4. **Expanding evaluation metrics**: Apart from the standard log-probability, other evaluation metrics can be employed, for instance BLEU, METEOR, TER, etc., which might provide a more holistic view of the translation performance and the extent of hallucinations.\n5. **Alternative training strategies**: It might be beneficial to consider alternative training strategies like adversarial training, where hallucination instances are artificially created and the model is trained to differentiate between them and legitimate translations.\n6. **Improved annotation methods**: Currently, the dataset contains annotations for only 323 hallucinations. Implementing more diverse and robust annotation techniques could improve the efficiency of hallucination detection.\n7. **Model Interpretability**: Developing interpretation tools for understanding the underlying reasons behind a model hallucinating could also help with its alleviation. This would involve developing methods to understand the internal workings of these models, and using this information to mitigate generation of hallucinations.'
