"### RESEARCH METHOD:\n\n1. **Dataset Compilation and Configuration**: Use the same dataset and deep learning model, the Transformer, as proposed by Guerreiro et al. (2022) to maintain consistency with their research. Gather a large dataset of annotated translations along with their generation sources. Use the held-out set of the dataset for analysis.\n\n2. **Hallucination Detection and Evaluation**: On the basis of the taxonomy provided by Guerreiro et al. (2022), differentiate the translation elements into categories of hallucinations, less severe translation errors, and correct translations. Hallucinations are defined as severe translation errors that are detached from the source, such as false repetitions or unrelated content. \n\n3. **Sequence Log-probability calculations**: Take advantage of sequence log-probability as part of internal model characteristics to detect hallucinations. Analyze sequence log-probability's efficiency compared to previous methods. \n\n4. **Implementing Source Contribution Method**: Evaluate the share of the source that contributes to a generated translation. The intuition is that hallucinations are translations disconnected from the source and can therefore be identified by a low source contribution. \n\n5. **Inclusion of External Tools**: Apart from the internal characteristics of the model, employ external tools such as sentence similarity derived from cross-lingual embeddings to improve results further. \n\n6. **Performance Testing and Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of source contribution and sentence similarity methods in alleviating hallucinations. Compare these results with previously used methods reliant on external models.\n\n7. **Iterations and Improvements**: Based on the results, make necessary adjustments or improvements to the methods employed and record the improvements against the initial performance. \n\n8. **Code Release**: In order to promote transparent and replicable science, conclude by releasing the code for your experiments."
