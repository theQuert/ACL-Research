Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is one of the compound tasks of fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aiming at extracting the triplets of aspect terms, corresponding opinion terms and the associated sentiment orientation. Recent efforts in exploiting span-level semantic interaction have shown superior performance on ASTE task. However, span-based approaches could suffer from excessive noise due to the large number of spans that have to be considered. To ease this burden, we propose a dual-channel span generation method to coherently constrain the search space of span candidates. Specifically, we leverage the syntactic relations among aspect/opinion terms and their part-of-speech characteristics to generate useful span candidates, which empirically reduces span enumeration by nearly a half. Besides, the interaction between syntactic and part-of-speech views brings relevant linguistic information to learned span representations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our design and the superiority on ASTE task 1 .  Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a compound task in fine-grained. \n Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) (Pontiki et al., 2014). When the idea of ASTE was first proposed, a two-stage pipeline method (Peng et al., 2020) was developed for this task. However, one prominent problem with spanbased methods is that they usually enumerate all spans in a sentence, which will bring about high computational cost and many noises. To address those issues, we explore the linguistic phenomena in the spans. Second, we also observe that there are some frequent patterns in aspect and opinion spans in terms of part-of-speech. Motivated by the two observations, we propose a dual-channel span generation approach for aspectlevel sentiment triplet extraction, which we term as Dual-Span. The experimental results show that our model Dual-Span outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the ASTE task. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) (Pontiki et al., 2014; Schouten and Frasincar, 2016; Xue and Li, 2018; Chen et al., 2022a; Trusca and Frasincar, 2023) is fine-grained sentiment analysis. The early work of ABSA was to identify its three sentiment elements (i.e., aspect, opinion, sentiment polarity) as basic tasks: ATE (e.g., (Yin et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2019; Chen and Qian, 2020; Li et al., 2020), OTE (Yang and Cardie, 2012, 2013; Wan et al., 2020)) and ASC (e.g., (Wang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Xue and Li, 2018; Du et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; Brauwers and Frasincar, 2023)). Subsequently, some studies began to consider multiple sentiment element composite tasks in order to better understand fine-grained sentiment analysis: aspect term polarity co-extraction (APCE) (Li and Lu, 2017; He et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019), AspectOpinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) (Zhao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Gao et al., 2021; Chakraborty et al., 2022) and Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA) (Schmitt et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Some recent works started to consider the integrity among the three sentiment elements and thus proposed the ASTE task. A diversity of techniques were proposed for it: two-stage pipeline (Peng et al., 2020), multi-task unified framework (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021), multi-round machine reading comprehension method (Mao et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2022) and end-to-end method (Wu et al., 2020a; Xu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021b, 2022c; Xu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022d). The span-level based approaches adopt end-to-end implementation. For instance, SpanASTE (Xu et al., 2021) enumerates aspect and viewpoint spans and directly exploits their interaction to solve ASTE tasks, while SBN (Chen et al., 2022d) proposed a span-level bidirectional network that enumerates all possible spans as input, and completes the ASTE task by designing two decoders and adopting inference strategies. Despite that, it still remains an open challenge to improve the search efficiency and feature representation for the span of sentiment triplets.
