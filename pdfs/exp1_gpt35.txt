Suitable research method for this paper could be "Experimental Method".\n\nGiven the abstract and related work, the authors of the paper are exploring the efficiency gains of ternary and binary neural networks in the context of transformer text generation models. They propose a mix of statistics-based quantization for weights and elastic quantization of activations. To validate their approach, they conduct experiments on downstream tasks such as summarization and machine translation, comparing the performance of their ternary and binary models with full-precision models and existing quantized models in the literature.\n\nThe experimental method would involve the following steps:\n\n1. Data collection: The researchers would collect benchmark datasets for summarization and machine translation tasks, such as the CNN/DailyMail dataset for summarization and the WMT16 En-Ro dataset for machine translation.\n\n2. Model implementation: The researchers would implement their ternary and binary transformer models, incorporating the proposed quantization methods for weights and activations. They would also implement the full-precision model for comparison.\n\n3. Experimental setup: The researchers would set up the experimental environment, including specialized hardware if applicable, to run their models. They would ensure that the hardware supports multiplication-free computation.\n\n4. Training and optimization: The researchers would train their models on the collected datasets using suitable optimization techniques. They would tune the hyperparameters and conduct experiments to find the optimal configuration for their models.\n\n5. Evaluation: The researchers would evaluate the performance of their ternary and binary models on the downstream tasks of summarization and machine translation. They would measure the metrics such as R1 score for summarization and BLEU score for machine translation. They would also compare the results with the full-precision model and existing quantized models in the literature.\n\n6. Analysis and interpretation: The researchers would analyze the experimental results and interpret the findings. They would discuss the efficiency gains achieved by their ternary and binary models compared to the full-precision model and the effectiveness of their proposed quantization methods. They would also compare their results with the existing literature and highlight the novel contributions of their approach.\n\n7. Discussion and conclusion: The researchers would discuss the implications of their findings, limitations of their approach, and potential future research directions. They would conclude the paper by summarizing the key findings and contributions.\n\nBy following the experimental method, the researchers can empirically validate the effectiveness and efficiency gains of their proposed ternary and binary transformer models for text generation tasks. They can provide evidence to support their claims and contribute to the existing body of research on neural network quantization.
