'METHOD: \n- Improvement of optimization algorithms for ternary and binary neural networks: One solution to mitigate the difficulties in optimizing ternary and binary neural networks is to develop more efficient optimization algorithms specifically tailored for these networks. This can involve designing novel gradient-based optimization methods that are better suited for the discrete parameter space and the highly quantized output space.\n- Quantization-aware training for transformer text generation models: Given the sensitivity of the attention operation to quantization and the noise-compounding effects of autoregressive decoding, a solution is to incorporate quantization-aware training techniques into transformer text generation models. This can involve introducing additional loss terms or regularization techniques that explicitly account for the quantization effects and encourage more accurate and efficient model learning.\n- Exploration of alternative quantization levels and methods: While the abstract mentions the use of ternary and binary weight models, it is important to explore other quantization levels and methods that may offer a better trade-off between model efficiency and accuracy. This can involve investigating higher precision quantization levels (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit) or exploring hybrid quantization schemes that combine different levels of quantization for different model components.\n- Comparison with state-of-the-art 8-bit weight models: In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed ternary and binary weight models, it is essential to compare their performance with the best existing 8-bit weight models in the literature. This can help assess the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed models in terms of model efficiency and accuracy.\n- Evaluation on different tasks and benchmarks: To further validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ternary and binary weight models, it is necessary to evaluate them on a range of tasks and benchmarks beyond the ones mentioned in the abstract. This can involve tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, or question answering, and benchmarks such as GLUE, SQuAD, or CoNLL.'
