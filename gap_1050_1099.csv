2. The application of the procedure on a yearly basis, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the variations in supply and demand growth over time and between regions.
3. The recognition that average annual price impacts may not be statistically significant, but there can still be price impacts from supply or demand shifts for specific periods. This implies a more dynamic and time-specific analysis of price behavior compared to the older paper.
4. The proposal that the procedure presented in the paper can be applied to any market with unstable price behavior, indicating its potential applicability beyond the world salmon market analyzed in the study. This generalization suggests a broader scope and usefulness of the research findings."
48,"From the comparison of the two abstracts, some improvements and advancements can be identified in the newer paper compared to the older paper:

1. The newer paper focuses specifically on analyzing the relative impact of supply and demand shifts on price changes, whereas the older paper discusses productivity growth in the supply chain, with less emphasis on price fluctuations.

2. The newer paper introduces the use of an Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM) to determine the relative impact of supply and demand shifts on price. This modeling technique provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to analyzing price impacts, which is not present in the older paper.

3. The newer paper conducts a detailed analysis of the world salmon market from 2002 to 2011, considering regional variations in supply and demand growth. This broader scope and longer time period allow for better insights into the dynamics of price impacts.

4. The newer paper acknowledges the limitations of using smooth trend indicators for measuring supply and demand shifts and proposes the presented procedure as a more appropriate instrument. This recognition of potential methodological shortcomings and the proposal of an alternative approach demonstrates a more critical and rigorous analysis in the newer paper.

Overall, the newer paper provides a more focused and advanced analysis of price changes and the impacts of supply and demand shifts. It introduces the Equilibrium Displacement Model as a novel technique and offers a comprehensive analysis of the world salmon market, addressing the limitations of previous methods."
49,"Improvements or advancements made in the newer paper compared to the older paper:
- The newer paper focuses on understanding price changes in the world salmon market, whereas the older paper talks about the growth and potential of aquaculture in general.
- The newer paper specifically addresses the relative impact of supply and demand shifts on price, while the older paper discusses innovations, productivity growth, and reduced production costs in aquaculture.
- The newer paper presents a method called Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM) to determine the relative impact on price from each supply and demand shift. The older paper does not mention any specific method for analyzing the impact of supply and demand shifts on price.

New methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper that were not present in the older paper:
- The newer paper introduces the use of the Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM) to quantify the impact of supply and demand shifts on price.
- The newer paper suggests that the use of smooth trend indicators is likely inappropriate for measuring supply and demand shifts and their impacts on price. This implies the need for alternative methods to capture the variability and non-linearity of supply and demand shifts.
- The newer paper applies the Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM) on a yearly basis and analyzes the world salmon market from 2002 to 2011. The older paper does not specify any specific time period or market focus."
