This scheme relies on a long-lived metastable excited state that exists for alkaline-earth or Ytterbium atoms, and an optical superlattice. 

The main improvement or advancement in the newer paper compared to the older one is the introduction of the optical superlattice to ensure that each lattice plaquette acquires the same phase, simulating a uniform magnetic field. This allows for a more controlled and realistic implementation of the artificial gauge field compared to the older paper's bichromatic light-shift potential.

Additionally, the newer paper outlines how the scheme can be generalized to non-Abelian gauge fields, indicating a further advancement in the understanding and application of the proposed scheme.

In terms of new methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper, the use of a long-lived metastable excited state and the optical superlattice are both novel approaches that were not present in the older paper. These elements provide the foundation for creating the strong U(1)-like gauge field on the cold atoms in the lattice."
45,"In comparing the newer and older versions of the abstracts, the papers discuss completely different topics, making it difficult to identify improvements or advancements in the newer paper compared to the older one. 

The newer version focuses on a scheme to create a strong U(1)-like gauge field on cold atoms in a two-dimensional square optical lattice. It introduces a long-lived metastable excited state and an optical superlattice to simulate a uniform magnetic field. The abstract further explores the observable consequences of the artificial gauge field on non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases, and mentions the possibility of generalizing the scheme to non-Abelian gauge fields. 

On the other hand, the older version discusses four-dimensional Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) as an asymptotically safe theory applicable at small distance scales. It presents the idea that spacetime is a fractal with an effective dimensionality of 2 on sub-planckian distances, based on the anomalous dimension of Newton's constant. The abstract highlights the microscopic spectral dimension being equal to 2, while it becomes 4 on macroscopic scales. It also connects this result with recent Monte Carlo simulations.

Therefore, as the two papers address separate topics, it is not possible to directly compare them in terms of improvements, advancements, or new methods/techniques proposed in the newer paper that were not present in the older paper."
