1. The newer paper does not explicitly mention any new methods or techniques proposed that were not present in the older paper. However, it implies that it utilizes the existing economic literature on pay for performance to develop recommendations for designing and implementing such systems. While this may not be a new method or technique itself, it shows the utilization and integration of existing knowledge and findings in a practical context.

Overall, the advancements in the newer paper lie in its recognition of the existing literature on pay for performance and its emphasis on applying that knowledge to real-world scenarios, potentially leading to more effective implementation strategies."
98,"Based on the provided abstracts, the newer paper seems to focus on the design and implementation of pay for performance systems, utilizing a large literature on the subject. This appears to be an advancement compared to the older paper, which investigated the relationship between students' perception of teachers' knowledge, attitude, and teaching skills on their academic performance. 

In terms of improvements or advancements in the newer paper, some key points can be highlighted:

1. The newer paper acknowledges the existence of a large, mature, and robust economic literature on pay for performance, bringing in a solid foundation to inform the design and implementation process. This shows a more informed approach compared to the older paper, which may have lacked comprehensive grounding in existing research.

2. The newer paper discusses the lessons from the literature and their practical implications, indicating a more practical and applicable approach to implementing pay for performance systems. The older paper, on the other hand, mainly focuses on investigating the relationship between variables without providing practical guidelines.

Regarding new methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper, the abstract does not explicitly mention any specific methods or techniques. However, it does indicate that the author uses the lessons from the literature to discuss the design and implementation of pay for performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the newer paper may propose new strategies or guidelines based on the existing literature that were not present in the older paper. Further details would be required from the full paper to identify the specific advancements made in the newer paper."
99,"Improvements or advancements in the newer paper compared to the older paper:
