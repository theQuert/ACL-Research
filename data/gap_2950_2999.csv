0,"Based on the provided abstracts, it is evident that the newer paper represents an advancement over the older paper. 

In the newer paper, the authors address the issue of governance costs in multinational companies (MNCs) and highlight the lack of empirical scrutiny in understanding these costs. They propose to investigate the factors driving these costs and hypothesize that they are influenced by external contingencies and the headquarters-subsidiary relationship. The authors utilize survey data from Norwegian MNCs to analyze 159 MNC-subsidiary relationships, which indicates the use of empirical research methods. This suggests a more rigorous and systematic approach in studying the topic.

In contrast, the older paper focuses on the relationship between episodic memory and the ability to imagine future events. It discusses the commonalities and limits of these parallels and emphasizes the fundamental differences between thinking about past and future events. The paper mentions the use of functional analyses as a potential avenue for future research, but does not provide specific details about any new methods or techniques proposed.

29,"Based on the provided abstracts, the newer paper focuses on the governance costs associated with establishing subsidiaries abroad in multinational companies. It hypothesizes that these costs are driven by external contingencies and factors characterizing the headquarters-subsidiary relationship. The newer paper uses survey data from Norwegian MNCs to investigate 159 MNC-subsidiary relationships and claims that their framework is supported by the data.

In contrast, the older paper discusses the ""human revolution"" model, which suggests that modern human behaviors emerged suddenly in the Old World around 40-50 ka. It challenges the Eurocentric bias and argues that many of the features attributed to the ""human revolution"" actually existed in the African archaeological record tens of thousands of years earlier.

In terms of improvements or advancements made in the newer paper compared to the older paper, the newer paper focuses on empirical scrutiny by using survey data from Norwegian MNCs to investigate governance costs. It addresses a gap in the literature by examining the implications of these costs in multinational companies. Additionally, the newer paper proposes a framework that considers external contingencies and factors characterizing the headquarters-subsidiary relationship as drivers of governance costs.
