4) Long-term emissions target: The newer paper proposes an alternative approach whereby a quantitative, long-term emissions target is chosen. The price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis would then be based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement required to achieve that target. This introduces a new method for determining the price of carbon and its impacts on regulatory decisions.

In summary, the newer paper improves upon the older paper by specifically addressing risk and uncertainty, emphasizing the analysis of low-probability, high-impact scenarios, critiquing the discounting approach, and proposing an alternative method based on a long-term emissions target. These advancements contribute to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the social cost of carbon and its implications for regulatory decision-making."
47,"In the newer paper, there are several improvements and advancements made compared to the older paper:

1. The newer paper focuses specifically on the treatment of risk and uncertainty in the ""social cost of carbon"" (SCC) for analysis of federal regulations, whereas the older paper discusses the damages function and its interaction with uncertain catastrophic outcomes in climate change economics more broadly.

2. The newer paper argues that the analysis of the US Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon did not sufficiently consider low-probability, high-impact scenarios, potentially leading to a significant underestimation of climate risk. This specific criticism is not present in the older paper.

3. The newer paper discusses the approach to discounting in the estimation of the SCC, suggesting that it contributes to the mis-estimation of climate risk. The older paper does not address discounting in the same context.

4. The newer paper proposes an alternative approach where a quantitative, long-term emissions target is chosen first, and the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis is then based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement to achieve that target. This proposed method is not present in the older paper.

Overall, the newer paper focuses on refining and improving the analysis of risk and uncertainty in the SCC and proposes an alternative approach to estimating the price of carbon. It introduces new perspectives and methods that were not present in the older paper."
48,"In the newer version of the abstract, there are several improvements or advancements made compared to the older version:

1. The newer version specifically focuses on the treatment of risk and uncertainty in the analysis of the 'social cost of carbon' (SCC), whereas the older version discusses the economic costs associated with climate change impacts and GHG emissions.
2. The newer version criticizes the analysis of the US Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon for not considering low-probability, high-impact scenarios in estimating climate risk, which the older version does not address.
3. The newer version suggests that a quantitative, long-term emissions target should be chosen, and the price of carbon should be based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement, whereas the older version discusses the optimal policy involving a modest rate of emission reduction followed by larger reductions later.

In terms of new methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper, the abstract does not explicitly mention any. However, it introduces the idea of considering low-probability, high-impact scenarios in the analysis of the SCC, and suggests using a quantitative emissions target to determine the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis. These ideas can be seen as new approaches to addressing risk, uncertainty, and estimating the social cost of carbon."
49,"In the newer version of the paper, there are several improvements or advancements compared to the older version. Firstly, the focus of the newer paper is on the treatment of risk and uncertainty in the social cost of carbon (SCC) for analysis of federal regulations in the United States. This is a more specific and targeted topic compared to the older paper, which discussed the difficulty of setting a shadow price on the environment in general.

Additionally, the newer paper criticizes the analysis conducted by the US Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon for not considering low-probability, high-impact scenarios and mis-estimating climate risk. This represents a more comprehensive evaluation of the current approach to SCC analysis, reflecting advancements in understanding and incorporating uncertainty and risk.

In terms of new methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper, it suggests that a quantitative, long-term emissions target should be chosen and the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis should be based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement to achieve that target. This approach provides a specific and measurable goal for environmental protection and links the price of carbon directly to the cost of achieving the target. This is a more concrete and actionable method compared to the older paper, which did not propose a specific approach for determining prices to achieve environmental targets.

Overall, the newer paper provides a more focused and critical analysis of the SCC analysis, and proposes a new approach based on long-term emissions targets and marginal cost of abatement. These advancements enhance the understanding and practicality of guiding public policy and incentivizing private behavior in relation to environmental protection."
