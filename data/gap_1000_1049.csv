0,"In comparing the abstracts of the newer and older papers, the newer version focuses on the treatment of risk and uncertainty in the context of the 'social cost of carbon' (SCC) for analyzing federal regulations in the United States. This represents an advancement as it narrows down the subject matter and applies it to a specific problem.

The newer paper critiques the US Interagency Working Group's analysis of the SCC, arguing that it did not adequately account for low-probability, high-impact scenarios. Additionally, it highlights the mis-estimation of climate risk through the group's approach to discounting. This critique is a significant improvement compared to the older paper, which merely reviewed empirical evidence and theoretical explanations of ambiguity and subjective expected utility (SEU). The newer paper provides a concrete analysis and critique of a specific application.

Furthermore, the newer paper suggests an alternative approach wherein a quantitative, long-term emissions target is chosen and the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis is based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement to achieve that target. This proposed method for determining the price of carbon is a new technique not present in the older paper.
