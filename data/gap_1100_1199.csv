4. Participatory sense-making: The newer paper mentions the concept of participatory sense-making, which offers a theoretical vocabulary to understand dynamic entanglement in joint speaking. This concept contributes to a rich scientific agenda by exploring how humans construct a shared world through dynamic interactions. The older paper does not propose such a concept or framework.

Overall, the advancements in the newer paper include broadening the scope of analysis, emphasizing the relevance of voice, discussing temporally bound subjectivity, and introducing the concept of participatory sense-making. These advancements offer a more comprehensive understanding of communication and open up new avenues for research and analysis."
98,"In the newer paper, there are several improvements and advancements compared to the older paper. 

Firstly, the newer paper focuses on the concept of voice and its connection to subjectivity, whereas the older paper primarily investigates the dynamic patterns of researchers' activities in an academic community. This shift in focus indicates a broader and more conceptual exploration in the newer paper.

Secondly, the newer paper emphasizes the interconnectedness and reciprocal influence between participants in real-time, suggesting a dynamic entanglement. This adds depth to understanding notions of common ground and socially shared cognition. In contrast, the older paper primarily analyzes power-law scaling and memory effects in academic forum activities.

Thirdly, the newer paper introduces the concept of participatory sense-making, which offers a theoretical framework to understand dynamic entanglement and shared world construction. This development opens up a rich scientific agenda and breaks away from a metaphysical approach. In contrast, the older paper does not propose any new theoretical concepts.

Regarding new methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper, it does not explicitly mention any. The focus of the newer paper seems to be more on conceptual advancements rather than proposing new methods or techniques."
99,"Comparing the two abstracts, it can be observed that the newer paper has made several improvements and advancements compared to the older paper.

Advancements in the Newer Paper:

1. Recognition of Arbitrary Boundaries: The newer paper questions the arbitrary boundaries conventionally separating the linguistic from the non-linguistic aspects of communication. It highlights that these boundaries often omit important elements present during vocal communication.

2. Voice Beyond Linguistics: The newer paper argues that uttering or voicing is a much older phenomenon than the formal structures studied by linguists. It suggests that the voice has found elaborations and codifications in other domains such as systems of ritual and rite. This expands the understanding of the role and significance of voice in human communication.

3. Temporally Bound Subjectivity: The newer paper proposes that voice gives rise to a temporally bound subjectivity. It discusses how inner speech, conversation, and synchronized utterances in collective speech (e.g., prayer, protest, sports arenas) contribute to the construction of a shared world. This adds a temporal dimension to the understanding of subjective experiences in communication.

4. Participatory Sense-Making: The newer paper introduces the concept of participatory sense-making, which provides a theoretical vocabulary to understand joint speaking and socially shared cognition. It offers a means to study and investigate the dynamic entanglement of participants and reciprocal influences in real-time communication.

5. Empirical Evidence: The newer paper mentions the presence of empirical evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies that support the idea of dynamic entanglement in joint speaking. This suggests a more empirical approach to the study of communication compared to the older paper.

Overall, the newer paper presents a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the relationship between speech, music, and joint speaking. It explores the broader significance of voice beyond linguistic structures and introduces concepts like participatory sense-making to advance the understanding of human communication.

New Methods/Techniques Proposed:

The newer paper does not explicitly propose any new methods or techniques. Instead, it emphasizes the need for a richer scientific agenda and suggests a departure from a stifling metaphysics that hinders understanding. It calls for the liberation of scientific inquiry to explore the means by which individuals come to inhabit a shared world. Therefore, while it introduces new concepts and perspectives, it does not explicitly introduce new methodologies or techniques."
