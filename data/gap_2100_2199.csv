There are also a couple of new methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper that were not present in the older paper:

1. Valuation Ratings for All Photographs: In the newer paper, subjects were tasked with giving valuation ratings for all photographs both before and after selecting their preference. This method allows for a comprehensive assessment of valuation changes compared to the older paper which did not employ this approach.

2. Replication of Valuation Increases and Decreases: The newer paper replicates a finding that valuation increases for chosen items and decreases for unchosen items, compared to a control condition. This replication strengthens the results and provides further evidence for the influence of choice on valuation. The older paper did not mention such replication.

This provides insights into the influence of the mode of action on decision-making processes and adds to the understanding of how choices are made and preferences are formed."
29,"In the newer version of the abstract, the study explores the impact of active versus passive choice on the choice process and preference change induced by choice. They investigated how choice is communicated not only through explicit actions but also through inaction. The subjects were asked to select a preference for unfamiliar photographs either through action or inaction, both before and after giving valuation ratings for all the photographs.
