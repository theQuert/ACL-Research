The development of general-domain neural machine translation (NMT) methods has advanced signiﬁcantly in recent years, but the lack of naturalness and musical constraints in the outputs makes them unable to produce singable lyric translations. This paper bridges the singability quality gap by formalizing lyric translation into a constrained translation problem, converting theoretical guidance and practical techniques from translatology literature to promptdriven NMT approaches, exploring better adaptation methods, and instantiating them to an English-Chinese lyric translation system. Our model achieves 99.85%, 99.00%, and 95.52% on length accuracy, rhyme accuracy, and word boundary recall. In our subjective evaluation, our model shows a 75% relative enhancement on overall quality, compared against naive ﬁnetuning 1 .With the globalization of entertainment, it is becom- output correctly translates the source, it ignores all ing increasingly common for people to appreciate the criteria that matter to make the output singable: songs in foreign languages. Obtaining singable lyric translations can facilitate the globalization of the music publishing industry to further promote the growth of its $5.9 billion USD market size (Veriﬁed Market Research, 2022).However, obtaining singable lyrics from MT systems is challenging.In contrast, the singable translation in the third row outperforms the MT output in all four aspects, all while maintaining translation ﬁdelity: it perfectly aligns with each musical note, has the same end-rhyme pattern for the two sentences (green text), a natural stop at the musical pause, and higher naturalness.
