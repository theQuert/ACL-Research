Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is one of the compound tasks of fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aiming at extracting the triplets of aspect terms, corresponding opinion terms and the associated sentiment orientation. Recent efforts in exploiting span-level semantic interaction have shown superior performance on ASTE task. However, span-based approaches could suffer from excessive noise due to the large number of spans that have to be considered. To ease this burden, we propose a dual-channel span generation method to coherently constrain the search space of span candidates. Specifically, we leverage the syntactic relations among aspect/opinion terms and their part-of-speech characteristics to generate useful span candidates, which empirically reduces span enumeration by nearly a half. Besides, the interaction between syntactic and part-of-speech views brings relevant linguistic information to learned span representations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our design and the superiority on ASTE task. Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a compound task in fine-grained Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) (Pontiki et al., 2014). When the idea of ASTE was first proposed, a two-stage pipeline method (Peng et al., 2020) was developed for this task. However, one prominent problem with spanbased methods is that they usually enumerate all spans in a sentence, which will bring about high computational cost and many noises.
