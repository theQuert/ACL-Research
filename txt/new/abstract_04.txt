Despite advances in large pre-trained neural language models, they are prone to generating toxic language, which brings security risks to their applications. We introduce MILDecoding, which detoxifies language models at token-level by interpolating it with a trained multiple instance learning (MIL) network. MIL model is trained on a corpus with a toxicity label for each text to predict the overall toxicity and the toxicity of each token in its context. Intuitively, the MIL network computes a toxicity distribution over next tokens according to the generated context which supplements the original language model to avoid toxicity. We evaluate MIL-Decoding with automatic metrics and human evaluation, where MIL-Decoding outperforms other baselines in detoxification while it only hurts generation fluency a little bit. Trained on huge amount of text corpora, Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) pretrained language models (LMs) have led to a wave of advances in natural language generation tasks (Radford et al. (2019); Lewis et al. (2019); Roberts et al. (2019)). We examine the public comments provided in Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge Dataset 1 (Jigsaw) containing over 200K comments that were labeled as toxic. Prior studies (Gehman et al., 2020) attempt to filter out a specific word list at the decoding stage, which cannot achieve an obvious effect on mitigating toxicity in the generated text. Therefore, we present MIL-Decoding, a tokenlevel detoxification in consideration of the contextual information with a multiple instance learning (MIL) neural network.
