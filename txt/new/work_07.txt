Our use of human feedback is related to work recently-termed reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; e.g., Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Scheurer et al., 2023). Largely, these methods rely on soliciting pair-wise comparisons from annotators, which are used to train a reward model to be used in an RL process. We adopt a different approach: soliciting feedback from users on single outputs to their queries, and mapping the feedback to reward values to be used in offline contextual bandit learning. An important consideration motivating our choice is that pair-wise comparison, although suitable for paid annotators, is less suitable for soliciting feedback from actual users. Head-to-head comparison between learning a reward model and directly mapping feedback to reward values, as we do, remains an important direction for future work. Human feedback has also been studied without RL (Xu et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022). A critical distinction of our work is the focus on continual learning (i.e., iteratively running our process over many rounds) and the dynamics it creates, whereas the work mentioned above (both using and not using RL) focused on improving models a single time. Learning from explicit or implicit feedback for language tasks was studied beyond recent interest in RLHF, including for machine translation (Nguyen et al., 2017; Kreutzer et al., 2018b,a), semantic parsing (Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011; Lawrence and Riezler, 2018), question answering (Gao et al., 2022), and chatbots (Jaques et al., 2020). Similar to the work mentioned earlier, this line of work did not explore iterative continual learning, as we emphasize. The iterative process was studied in the context of embodied instruction generation (Kojima et al., 2021) and following (Thomason et al., 2015; Suhr and Artzi, 2022). In contrast, we study QA on a wide range of Wikipedia articles, data with high lexical diversity. Others obtained complete labels as feedback (Iyer et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016), a process with higher overhead. RL using human feedback has also been studied for non-language problems (e.g., Knox and Stone, 2015; Warnell et al., 2017; MacGlashan et al., 2017; Christiano et al., 2017).
