Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is one of the compound tasks of fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), aiming at extracting the triplets of aspect terms, corresponding opinion terms and the associated sentiment orientation. Recent efforts in exploiting span-level semantic interaction shown superior performance on ASTE task. However, most of the existing span-based approaches suffer from enumerating all possible spans, since it can introduce too much noise in sentiment triplet extraction. To ease this burden, we propose a dual-channel span generation method to coherently constrain the search space of span candidates. Specifically, we leverage the syntactic relations among aspect/opinion terms and the associated part-of-speech characteristics in those terms to generate span candidates, which reduces span enumeration by nearly half. Besides, feature representations are learned from syntactic and part-of-speech correlation among terms, which renders span representation fruitful linguistic information. Extensive experiments on two versions of public datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness of our design and the superiority on ASTE/ATE/OTE tasks. Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a compound task in fine-grained Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) (Pontiki et al., 2014). When the idea of ASTE was first proposed, a two-stage pipeline method (Peng et al., 2020) was developed for this task. However, one prominent problem with spanbased methods is that they usually enumerate all spans in a sentence, which will bring about high computational cost and many noises. To address those issues, we explore the linguistic phenomena in the spans.
