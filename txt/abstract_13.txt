Extrapolation reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) aims to forecast future facts based on past counterparts. There are two main challenges: (1) incorporating the complex information, including structural dependencies, temporal dynamics, and hidden logical rules; (2) implementing differentiable logical rule learning and reasoning for explainability. To this end, we propose an explainable extrapolation reasoning framework TEemporal logiCal grapH networkS (TECHS), which mainly contains a temporal graph encoder and a logical decoder. The former employs a graph convolutional network with temporal encoding and heterogeneous attention to embed topological structures and temporal dynamics. The latter integrates propositional reasoning and first-order reasoning by introducing a reasoning graph that iteratively expands to find the answer. A forward message-passing mechanism is also proposed to update node representations, and their propositional and first-order attention scores. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are widely used in intelligent systems (Ji et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023), where knowledge is commonly represented by triplets in the form of (s, r, o). TKGs are usually incomplete (Cai et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022). Motivated by the fact that TKGs have many hidden logical rules to achieve explainable and accurate predictions, TLogic (Liu et al., 2022) searched first-order logical rules and used them for reasoning. To address above issues, we propose a unified framework TEemporal logiCal grapH networkS (TECHS). It first utilizes a graph convolutional network (GCN) to embed topological structures and temporal dynamics. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) A unified framework TECHS is proposed to conduct explainable extrapolation reasoning on TKGs.
