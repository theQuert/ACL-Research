Attribute Extraction is a classical IE task with extensive research. In earlier years, heuristic rules and dictionaries were usually used to iden-tify attributes and extract attribute values from the texts (Tan et al., 1999; Sasaki and Matsuo, 2000; Vandic et al., 2012; More, 2016; Zheng et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2021). With the development of deep learning for NLP, researchers attempt to leverage neural network technology-based model for tagging attributes (Huang et al., 2015; Hakkani-TÃ¼r et al., 2016; Mai et al., 2018) or classifying attribute types (Riedel et al., 2010; Zeng et al., 2014; Amplayo, 2019; Iter et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). Beyond CWA AE, researchers also explore AE in OWA scenario, e.g., some prior works try to expand free attributes from plain texts (Wong and Lam, 2010; Zhang et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2018) and extract the values of schema-free attributes (Xu et al., 2019). Recently, more novel frameworks are proposed to generalize the capacity of AE models. AVEQA (Wang et al., 2020; Shinzato et al., 2022) and MAVEQA (Yang et al., 2022) introduce Question Answering framework for AE task, and Roy et al. (2022) tries to employ large-scale PLM to introduce external knowledge. Further, some academics propose multimodal AE tasks and datasets to enrich the research (IV et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2020). Generative Information Extraction, a rising technique in these two years (Ye et al., 2022), is also an inspiration for proposing this research. A contemporaneous work (Roy et al., 2022) adopts sequence generation models and preliminarily shows the potential of generative models in open-world attribute extraction. Alongside sequence-based generation models, structure generation models are also widely studied and have shown power in other IE tasks. For example, REBEL (Huguet Cabot and Navigli, 2021) introduces a structure-linearized model for relation extraction; Seq2UMTree (Zhang et al., 2020) conducts a sequence-to-unorderedmulti-tree generation model for extracting entities and relations jointly; UIE (Lu et al., 2022) proposes a text-to-structure generation framework that can universally model different IE tasks based on the guidance of the pre-defined schema. Though both attribute extraction and generative models have been widely explored, we are the first to design a novel tree generation model for AE and demonstrate the effectiveness on our unified real-world paradigm.
