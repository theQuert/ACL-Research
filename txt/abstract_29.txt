Factual correctness is often the limiting factor in practical applications of natural language generation in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. An essential requirement for maintaining factuality is the ability to deal with rare tokens. This paper focuses on rare tokens that appear in both the source and the reference sequences, and which, when missed during generation, decrease the factual correctness of the output text. For high-stake domains that are also knowledge-rich, we show how to use knowledge to (a) identify which rare tokens that appear in both source and reference are important and (b) uplift their conditional probability. We introduce the “utilization rate” that encodes knowledge and serves as a regularizer by maximizing the marginal probability of selected tokens. We present a study in a knowledgerich domain of healthcare, where we tackle the problem of generating after-visit care instructions based on patient-doctor dialogues. We verify that, in our dataset, specific medical concepts with high utilization rates are underestimated by conventionally trained sequence-tosequence models. We observe that correcting this with our approach to knowledge injection reduces the uncertainty of the model as well as improves factuality and coherence without negatively impacting fluency. Recent advances in language modeling (c.f. Dong et al. (2021); Erdem et al. (2022) for survey) have enabled applications across multiple domains including education (Shen et al., 2021), jurisprudence (Bell et al., 2021), e-commerce (Zhang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2021), and healthcare (Valmianski et al., 2021; Compton et al., 2021; Alambo et al., 2022; Krishna et al., 2020). Prior approaches for handling rare word generation utilize a copy mechanism (See et al., 2017; Joshi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Choi et al., 2021).
