In this paper, we propose S IM LM (Similarity matching with Language Model pre-training), a simple yet effective pre-training method for dense passage retrieval. It employs a simple bottleneck architecture that learns to compress the passage information into a dense vector through self-supervised pre-training. We use a replaced language modeling objective, which is inspired by ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020), to improve the sample efﬁciency and reduce the mismatch of the input distribution between pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. S IM LM only requires access to an unlabeled corpus and is more broadly applicable when there are no labeled data or queries. We conduct experiments on several large-scale passage retrieval datasets and show substantial improvements over strong baselines under various settings. Remarkably, S IM LM even outperforms multivector approaches such as ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al., 2021) which incurs signiﬁcantly more storage cost. Our code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/ microsoft/unilm/tree/master/simlm. Passage retrieval is an important component in applications like ad-hoc information retrieval, opendomain question answering (Karpukhin et al., 2020), retrieval-augmented generation (Lewis et al., 2020) and fact veriﬁcation (Thorne et al., 2018). Like other NLP tasks, dense retrieval beneﬁts greatly from a strong general-purpose pre-trained language model.
