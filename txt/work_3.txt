In this section, we describe the framework and data we use for evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation methods. This framework was proposed by Guerreiro et al. (2022) and consists of a large dataset of annotated translations along with the model that produced them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only released data that can be used to analyze hallucinations in a “clean” setting. The model is Transformer base (Vaswani et al., 2017) from fairseq (Ott et al., 2019) with the standard hyperparameters setting. It was trained on the WMT’18 German-English news translation data excluding Paracrawl (Bojar et al., 2018) – totalling 5.8M sentence pairs. Since Guerreiro et al. (2022) used randomly chosen 1/3 of the dataset as a held-out set for analysis, the model was trained on the remaining 2/3 of the dataset. We use the model released by Guerreiro et al. (2022) that has been used to generate the hallucinations we analyze. The hallucination dataset released by Guerreiro et al. (2022) contains fine-grained manual annotations of 3415 German-to-English translations generated by the model above. These translations are chosen from a set of 1.8M translations of heldout data as the ones that are likely to be pathological. The criteria used to flag the translations include 10 methods ranging from previously proposed heuristics (Lee et al., 2019; Berard et al., 2019; Raunak et al., 2021) to quality estimation models (Rei et al., 2020b) and uncertainty detectors (Fomicheva et al., 2020; Zerva et al., 2021; Guerreiro et al., 2022). The taxonomy of translation pathologies in the dataset is shown in Figure 1. Here, hallucinations are defined as severe translation errors that are detached from the source. These can be either oscillatory (i.e. contain erroneous repetitions of words and phrases) or largely fluent. The latter is further split by severity of an error into fully detached (the whole content is not supported by the source) and strongly, but not fully, detached (significant proportion of output is not supported by the source). 2 Additionally, the annotated data contains translation errors that are deemed not detached from the source (Figure 1). Overall, 323 examples are judged to be hallucinations, 1044 are less severe translation errors and the rest are correct translations. Note that so far, there is no “canonical” hallucination taxonomy and previous work used various, mostly overlapping, definitions (Lee et al., 2019; Raunak et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2022; Raunak et al., 2022; Guerreiro et al., 2022). We follow the taxonomy by Guerreiro et al. (2022) for consistency with the dataset and the evaluation framework we use and because this taxonomy is general enough for our purposes.
