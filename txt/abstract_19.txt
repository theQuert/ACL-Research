Cross-domain Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to leverage the useful knowledge from a source domain to identify aspectsentiment pairs in sentences from a target domain. To tackle the task, several recent works explore a new unsupervised domain adaptation framework, i.e., Cross-Domain Data Augmentation (CDDA), aiming to directly generate much labeled target-domain data based on the labeled source-domain data. However, these CDDA methods still suffer from several issues: 1) preserving many source-specific attributes such as syntactic structures; 2) lack of fluency and coherence; 3) limiting the diversity of generated data. To address these issues, we propose a new cross-domain Data Augmentation approach based on Domain-Adaptive Language Modeling named DA 2 LM, which contains three stages: 1) assigning pseudo labels to unlabeled target-domain data; 2) unifying the process of token generation and labeling with a Domain-Adaptive Language Model (DALM) to learn the shared context and annotation across domains; 3) using the trained DALM to generate labeled target-domain data. Experiments show that DA 2 LM consistently outperforms previous feature adaptation and CDDA methods on both ABSA and Aspect Extraction tasks. The source code is publicly released at https://github.com/NUSTM/DALM. As an important task in sentiment analysis, AspectBased Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to extract aspect terms from sentences and predict the sentiment polarity towards each aspect term (Liu, 2012; Pontiki et al., 2016). To alleviate the reliance on labeled data, many previous works resorted to unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, which aim to transfer knowledge from a resource-rich source domain to a target domain only with unlabeled data (Blitzer et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2010; Zhuang et al., 2015). To address this limitation, several recent studies have explored a new domain adaptation framework named Cross-Domain Data Augmentation (CDDA), which aims to directly generate much target-domain labeled data based on the labeled data from the source domain.
