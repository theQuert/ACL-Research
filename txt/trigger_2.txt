Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) (Pontiki et al., 2014; Schouten and Frasincar, 2016; Xue and Li, 2018; Chen et al., 2022a; Trusca and Frasincar, 2023) is fine-grained sentiment analysis. The early work of ABSA was to identify its three sentiment elements (i.e., aspect, opinion, sentiment polarity) as basic tasks: ATE (e.g., (Yin et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2019; Chen and Qian, 2020; Li et al., 2020), OTE (Yang and Cardie, 2012, 2013; Wan et al., 2020)) and ASC (e.g., (Wang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016; Xue and Li, 2018; Du et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021; Brauwers and Frasincar, 2023)). Subsequently, some studies began to consider multiple sentiment element composite tasks in order to better understand fine-grained sentiment analysis: aspect term polarity co-extraction (APCE) (Li and Lu, 2017; He et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019), AspectOpinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) (Zhao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Gao et al., 2021; Chakraborty et al., 2022) and Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA) (Schmitt et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Some recent works started to consider the integrity among the three sentiment elements and thus proposed the ASTE task. A diversity of techniques were proposed for it: two-stage pipeline (Peng et al., 2020), multi-task unified framework (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021), multi-round machine reading comprehension method (Mao et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2022) and end-to-end method (Wu et al., 2020a; Xu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021b, 2022c; Xu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022d). The span-level based approaches adopt end-to-end implementation. For instance, SpanASTE (Xu et al., 2021) enumerates aspect and viewpoint spans and directly exploits their interaction to solve ASTE tasks, while SBN (Chen et al., 2022d) proposed a span-level bidirectional network that enumerates all possible spans as input, and completes the ASTE task by designing two decoders and adopting inference strategies. Despite that, it still remains an open challenge to improve the search efficiency and feature representation for the span of sentiment triplets.
