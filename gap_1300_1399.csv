3. Spearmen-Brown prophecy formula: The newer paper uses the Spearmen-Brown prophecy formula to estimate the number of monitoring days needed to achieve a certain level of reliability. The older paper does not mention the use of this formula."
93,"Improvements or advancements made in the newer paper compared to the older paper:
1. The newer paper focuses on determining the reliability of objectively assessed sedentary behavior (SED) and physical activity (PA) in adults, while the older paper mainly examines the associations between screen time, sitting time, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The newer paper provides more specific information on the measurement of SED and PA and their reliability.

New methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper that were not present in the older paper:
1. The newer paper uses the GT3X+ accelerometer for 21 subsequent days to explore different wear time criteria (8 to 12 h/day and 3 to 5 d/week) for reliable assessment of SED and PA. This extended period of measurement allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the reliability of these measurements.
2. Variance partitioning and the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula are used to determine intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and the number of monitoring days needed to achieve an ICC = 0.80. These statistical techniques provide a more rigorous analysis of reliability and determine the optimal number of monitoring days needed.
3. Bland-Altman plots and absolute measures of agreement are used to assess week-by-week reliability, providing a visual representation and quantitative measure of agreement between monitoring days.
4. The newer paper highlights the importance of adjusting for wear time when determining SED, as the number of days needed for reliable assessment varied depending on whether adjustments were made or not.
5. The newer paper also emphasizes the need for more than one week of measurement for most variables to achieve an ICC = 0.80, taking into account the variability in daily activity patterns. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the required measurement duration for reliable assessment of SED and PA."
94,"In the newer paper compared to the older paper, there are several improvements and advancements made. 

Firstly, the newer paper focuses on assessing the reliability of sedentary behavior (SED) and physical activity (PA) measurements in adults, whereas the older paper primarily analyzed patterns of physical activity using latent class analysis (LCA). This shift in focus indicates that the newer paper addresses the need for more reliable measurements of SED and PA.

Secondly, the newer paper utilizes accelerometer data from a longer period of 21 subsequent days, while the older paper only used 7 days of accelerometer data. This extended period of measurement in the newer paper allows for a more comprehensive analysis of patterns and reliability of SED and PA.

Additionally, the newer paper introduces the use of different wear time criteria (8 to 12 h/day and 3 to 5 d/week) to explore reliability, while the older paper does not mention any considerations for wear time. This new method in the newer paper acknowledges the importance of wear time in accurately assessing SED and PA.

Furthermore, the newer paper employs variance partitioning and the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula to determine intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and the number of monitoring days needed to achieve an ICC = 0.80. These statistical techniques were not mentioned in the older paper.

Overall, the newer paper not only expands on the previous research by investigating the reliability of SED and PA measurements but also introduces new methods and techniques for analysis, such as considering wear time and using variance partitioning and the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula."

New methods or techniques proposed in the newer paper that were not present in the older paper:

1. Correcting for wear time: The newer paper highlighted the importance of correcting for wear time when determining sedentary behavior. They compared the number of monitoring days needed with and without wear time adjustments. The older paper did not mention the need for wear time adjustments.
2. Additional variables assessed: The newer paper assessed overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and light physical activity, in addition to sedentary behavior. The older paper did not mention the assessment of specific physical activity intensities.
3. Limits of agreement: The newer paper provided limits of agreement for each variable, indicating the range within which the measurements were considered reliable. The older paper did not mention limits of agreement.

97,"Comparing the two abstracts, the newer version of the paper makes some improvements and advancements compared to the older paper. 

1. In the newer version, the authors conducted a study to determine the reliability of objectively assessed sedentary behavior (SED) and physical activity (PA) in adults. This study involved 87 adult subjects wearing the GT3X+ accelerometer for 21 subsequent days. In contrast, the older paper did not mention any specific study or subject details; it only described the exploratory analysis of accelerometry data from the Canadian Health Measures Survey.

2. The newer version presents specific findings regarding the number of monitoring days needed to reliably assess different types of physical activity. It states that 7-10 days of monitoring were needed to assess overall PA and moderate-to-vigorous PA, while 3-4 days were needed for light PA. The number of days needed for sedentary behavior varied depending on adjustments for wear time. In comparison, the older paper only discussed the minimum number of valid days required for analysis without providing any specific figures.

3. The newer version introduces the concept of adjusting for wear time when determining sedentary behavior. It mentions that the number of days needed for sedentary behavior assessment differed depending on whether adjustments for wear time were made or not. The older paper did not mention or discuss wear time adjustments.

4. The newer paper uses Variance partitioning along with the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula to determine intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and the number of monitoring days needed to achieve an ICC = 0.80. This methodological detail was not mentioned in the older paper.

Therefore, the improvements and advancements in the newer paper include a specific study design, specific findings on monitoring days for different types of physical activity, the introduction of wear time adjustments for sedentary behavior assessment, and the use of Variance partitioning and the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula for determining ICC and monitoring days. These methods and techniques were not proposed or mentioned in the older paper."
