1061,"It is difficult to overvalue the importance of polysaccharides for the great number of applicative fields in which they appeared. Oligosaccharides are relatively short compounds that are prepared from the longer polysaccharides or could also be found as such in nature. The potential in bioactivity of marine polysaccharides is still considered under-exploited and these molecules, including the derived oligosaccharides, are an extraordinary source of chemical diversity. Sustainable ways to access marine oligosaccharides are particularly important in view of the huge list of the effects they play in cell events; enzymatic tools, on which these sustainable ways are based, and modern techniques for purification and for the investigation of chemical structures, will be shortly discussed indicating the most important recent literature. Marine microalgae have been used for a long time as food for humans, such as Arthrospira (formerly, Spirulina), and for animals in aquaculture. The biomass of these microalgae and the compounds they produce have been shown to possess several biological applications with numerous health benefits. Scientific knowledge present in literature for each of these sources seems to differ, from the well-known seaweed (Rinaudo, 2007) to relatively new sources of polysaccharides such as extremophiles and microalgae (#CITATION_TAG).","It goes through the most studied activities of sulphated polysaccharides (sPS) or their derivatives, but also highlights lesser known applications as hypolipidaemic or hypoglycaemic, or as biolubricant agents and drag-reducers.","['The present review puts up-to-date the research on the biological activities and applications of polysaccharides, active biocompounds synthesized by marine unicellular algae, which are, most of the times, released into the surrounding medium (exo- or extracellular polysaccharides, EPS).', 'Therefore, the great potentials of sPS from marine microalgae to be used as nutraceuticals, therapeutic agents, cosmetics, or in other areas, such as engineering, are approached in this review']"

From 1991-2008, MS prevalence increased by 4.7 % on average per year (p \ 0.001) from 78.8/100,000 (95 % CI 75.7, 82.0) to 179.9/100,000 (95 % CI 176.0, 183.8), the sex prevalence ratio increased from 2.27 to 2.78 (p \ 0.001) and the peak prevalence age range increased from 45-49 to 55-59 years. MS incidence and prevalence in BC are among the highest in the world. Neither the incidence nor the incidence sex ratio increased over time. ABSTRACT: A province wide prevalence study on multiple sclerosis (MS) was conducted in British Columbia (B.C.). These rates are among the highest reported in Canada or elsewhere. neurologists made this study unique in its scope and accuracy of diagnosis. Other than a study based on self-reported MS [21], the last province-wide estimate of MS prevalence, which used clinically confirmed definitions, was 93.3/100,000 in 1982 [#CITATION_TAG].","239,412 neurologists' files were hand searched by one researcher using modified Schumacher criteria for classification. Other sources used during the study for identifying MS patients were the MS Clinic, general practitioners, ophthalmologists, urologists, specialized facilities such as long term care facilities and rehabilitation centres, and patient self-referrals. A total of 4,620 non-duplicated cases were identified and classified.",['The major portion of this study was a review of all the files of neurologists practicing in B.C.']

420,"A great deal of the research and theorizing on consciousness and the brain, including my own on hallucinations for example (Collerton and Perry, 2011) has focused upon specific changes in conscious content which can be related to temporal changes in restricted brain systems. In this paper, I will review why psychotherapy is relevant to the question of how consciousness relates to brain plasticity. Changes in neural activity of cortical-limbic regions that subserve hypervigilance and emotion regulation may represent biologically oriented change mechanisms that mediate symptom improvement of CT for IBS. For example, very similar changes in those brain areas are seen after CBT and other psychological treatments for anxiety (Furmark et al., 2002;Paquette et al., 2003;Straube et al., 2006;Porto et al., 2009;Freyer et al., 2011), schizophrenia ( Wykes et al., 2002), eating disorders (Vocks et al., 2011) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( #CITATION_TAG et al., 2006)","Five healthy controls and 6 Rome II diagnosed IBS patients underwent psychological testing followed by rectal balloon distention while brain neural activity was measured with O-15 water positron emission tomography (PET) before and after a brief regimen of CT. Pre-treatment resting state scans, without distention, were compared to post-treatment scans using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Neural activity in the parahippocampal gyrus and inferior portion of the right cortex cingulate were reduced in the post-treatment scan, compared to pre-treatment (x, y, z coordinates in MNI standard space were -30, -12, -30, P=0.017; 6, 34, -8, P=0.023, respectively). Limbic activity changes were accompanied by significant improvements in GI symptoms (e.g., pain, bowel dysfunction) and psychological functioning (e.g., anxiety, worry).",['This study sought to identify brain regions that underlie symptom changes in severely affected IBS patients undergoing cognitive therapy (CT).']

609,"The main problem with the state of the art in the semantic search domain is the lack of comprehensive evaluations. There exist only a few efforts to evaluate semantic search tools and to compare the results with other evaluations of their kind. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for testing and benchmarking semantic search tools that was developed within the SEALS project. The logic-based machine-understandable framework of the Semantic Web typically challenges casual users when they try to query ontologies. An often proposed solution to help casual users is the use of natural language interfaces. Such tools, however, suffer from one of the biggest problems of natural language: ambiguities. Furthermore, the systems are hardly adaptable to new domains. Searching the Semantic Web lies at the core of many activities that are envisioned for the Semantic Web; many researchers have investigated means for indexing and searching the Semantic Web [1] [2] [3] [4] 6, 9, 13, #CITATION_TAG, 16].","The approach allows queries in natural language, thereby asking the user for clarification in case of ambiguities.","['This paper addresses these issues by presenting Querix, a domain-independent natural language interface for the Semantic Web.']"
392,"In many European countries, municipalities are becoming increasingly important as providers of electronic public services to their citizens. One of the horizons for further expansion is the delivery of personalised electronic services. In this paper, we describe the diffusion of personalised services in the Netherlands over the period 2006-2009 and investigate how and why various municipalities adopted personalised electronic services. In doing so, this article contributes to an institutional view on adoption and diffusion of innovations, in which (1) horizontal and vertical channels of persuasion and (2) human agency, rather than technological opportunity and rational cost-benefit considerations, account for actual diffusion of innovations. When the school opened in 1971, the existing 86 medical schools all offered similar programs: two years of basic science training in lecture halls and laboratories, followed by two years of direct contact with patients in clinical settings. In the new school, students were taught didactically only during the first year. Hence, institutionalism emphasises the persuasive control over the practices, beliefs and belief systems of individuals or organisations through an institution's sway (#CITATION_TAG, in King et al., 1994.","During the second year, each student was assigned to a community physician who acted as an advisor and who discussed with students those patients afflicted with the diseases the student was currently studying. The author found the case of this medical school to be of particular interest from an organizational viewpoint in that: (1) the early development of the school was shaped by the first dean's entrepreneurial activity, ambitions, visions, strengths, and weaknesses; (2) the uncertainty resulting from the school's novelty forced individuals to assume new roles and face unclear performance criteria; and (3) the transition of an innovative school to an institutionalized one was problematic because it modified the decision-making process. The author suggests that those things which lead to an organization's success during its early years are not the same as those that lead to longer-run success. A comparative analysis of the birth, life, and death of organization is advocated.","['Kimberly presents a case study of the birth and early development of an innovative medical school.', 'He says that a new organization creates new norms, values, and procedures whereas the elements of an existing organization interact within an established culture.']"
1049,"The fluid parcels reside at the base of the tree. The tree structure partitions the fluid parcels into adjacent pairs (or more generally, p-tuples). Adjacent parcels intermix at rates governed by diffusion time scales based on molecular diffusivities and parcel sizes. Keywords Turbulence * Stochastic model * Mixing 1 Motivation Mixing closure in computational models of turbulent combustion is typically implemented by partially or fully intermixing pairs or groups of notional fluid parcels selected from a parcel population that discretely instantiates the joint probability distribution function (PDF) of the thermochemical variables that are time advanced by the model [10] . One such constraint that has proven effective is to intermix only parcel pairs that are close, by some criterion, in a metric space defined on the manifold of thermochemical states [26] . THE AREA UNDER CULTIVATION IN SOUTH Africa more than tripled during the twentieth century, while plantation area increased more than tenfold. Both domestic and global population growth partly underlie the increased demand for crop products over the past century. Increased production was initially achieved mainly by expanding the area under cultivation, and, from the 1960s onwards, principally through enhanced yields per hectare. In the latter period, nationally averaged productivity in a given year was related to fertilizer use, irrigation and the proportion of the country experiencing dry conditions. Tree geometry has been used for reduced modeling of turbulence intermittency [2, 4, 5, 14, 22], in some instances formulated as generalizations of the zero-dimensional shell models [6, #CITATION_TAG] in which the scale space of turbulence is parameterized by wavenumber modulus.","Independent estimates of historical cultivated area at the national level were derived from estimates of production and productivity per hectare, presenting a method that could be used to obtain improved historical land-cover estimates in data-poor countries.","['This paper describes the changes that have occurred in relation to the production and yields per hectare of major crops (maize, wheat, sorghum and sugar cane) and discusses the factors that contributed to the changes.']"

32,"Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. We extracted the brain from the skull using the BET toolbox for both the FLAIR and the structural T1 weighted images and these scans were registered to standard space using FLIRT (#CITATION_TAG).","It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method.",['This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures.']
198,"The fungicides used to control diseases in cereal production can have adverse effects on non-target fungi, with possible consequences for plant health and productivity. The fungal community on wheat leaves consisted mainly of basidiomycete yeasts, saprotrophic ascomycetes and plant pathogens. This study examined fungicide effects on fungal communities on winter wheat leaves in two areas of Sweden. Foliar fungal communities of plants are diverse and ubiquitous. In grasses endophytes may increase host fitness; in trees, their ecological roles are poorly understood. At the time of the sampling the poplars had been growing in a common garden for two years. Leucosporidium golubevii is a yeast discovered in freshwater [46], and has been reported from the phyllosphere of balsam poplar [#CITATION_TAG].","We sampled leaves from genotyped balsam poplars from across the species' range, and applied 454 amplicon sequencing to characterize foliar fungal communities. We found diverse fungal communities associated with the poplar leaves. The observed patterns may be explained by a filtering mechanism which allows the trees to selectively recruit fungal strains from the environment. Alternatively, host genotype-specific fungal communities may be present in the tree systemically, and persist in the host even after two clonal reproductions.",['We investigated whether the genotype of the host tree influences community structure of foliar fungi.']
479,"to a Cartesian view of distinct unobservable minds. Voice, it is suggested, necessarily gives rise to a temporally bound subjectivity, whether it is in inner speech (Descartes' ""cogito""), in conversation, or in the synchronized utterances of collective speech found in prayer, protest, and sports arenas world wide. The notion of a fleeting subjective pole tied to dynamically entwined participants who exert reciprocal influence upon each other in real time provides an insightful way to understand notions of common ground, or socially shared cognition. It suggests that the remarkable capacity to construct a shared world that is so characteristic of Homo sapiens may be grounded in this ability to become dynamically entangled as seen, e.g., in the centrality of joint attention in human interaction. Empirical evidence of dynamic entanglement in joint speaking is found in behavioral and neuroimaging studies. A convergent theoretical vocabulary is now available in the concept of participatory sense-making, leading to the development of a rich scientific agenda liberated from a stifling metaphysics that obscures, rather than illuminates, the means by which we come to inhabit a shared world. Questioning this commitment leads us to recognize that the boundaries conventionally separating the linguistic from the non-linguistic can appear arbitrary, omitting much that is regularly present during vocal communication. The thesis is put forward that uttering, or voicing, is a much older phenomenon than the formal structures studied by the linguist, and that the voice has found elaborations and codifications in other domains too, such as in systems of ritual and rite. Recommender systems learn about user preferences over time, automatically finding things of similar interest. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations.Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This approach is rooted in dynamical approaches to coordination that are levelagnostic, seeking to understand emergent phenomena at one level (e.g., the dyad) as arising through processes of self-organization from the constrained interaction of autonomous components at a lower level (the speaker/listeners) (Kelso, 1995; #CITATION_TAG).",This reduces the burden of creating explicit queries.

28,"Unlike most previous research that focused on the relationship between rs-fcMRI and a single behavioral measure of EF, in the current study we examined the relationship of rs-fcMRI with individual differences in subcomponents of EF. Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (#CITATION_TAG).","From these three measures, we derived estimates of common aspects of EF, as well as abilities specific to working memory updating and task shifting.

We then used dual regression to explore how these RSNs covaried with individual differences in EF.","['The goal of the present study was to examine relationships between individual differences in resting state functional connectivity as ascertained by fMRI (rs-fcMRI) and performance on tasks of executive function (EF), broadly defined as the ability to regulate thoughts and actions.']"
1015,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Design Two year nationwide retrospective study, 2005-6 (SENTI-MELC study).Data collection via the sentinel network of general practitioners, an epidemiological surveillance system representative of all general practitioners in Belgium.1690 non-sudden deaths in practices of the sentinel general practitioners.Non-sudden deaths of patients (aged >1 year) reported each week. To a large extent receiving spiritual care was associated with higher frequencies of euthanasia or physician assisted suicide than receiving little spiritual care (18.5, 2.0 to 172.7).End of life decisions that shorten life, including euthanasia or physician assisted suicide, are not related to a lower use of palliative care in Belgium and often occur within the context of multidisciplinary care. The relationship between euthanasia and spiritual or existential caregiving to the patient has been examined in a study involving the last three months of life of patients of a representative panel of Belgian general practitioners (#CITATION_TAG).","Multivariable regression analysis controlled for age, sex, cause, and place of death.Use of specialist multidisciplinary palliative care services was associated with intensified alleviation of symptoms (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.6), continuous deep sedation forgoing food/fluid (2.9, 1.7 to 4.9), and the total of decisions explicitly intended to shorten life (1.5, 1.1 to 2.1) but not with euthanasia or physician assisted suicide in particular.",['To explore the relation between the care provided in the final three months of life and the prevalence and types of end of life decisions in Belgium.']
561,"Much bioethical scholarship is concerned with the social, legal and philosophical implications of new and emerging science and medicine, as well as with the processes of research that under-gird these innovations. Science and technology studies (STS), and the related and interpenetrating disciplines of anthropology and sociology, have also explored what novel technoscience might imply for society, and how the social is constitutive of scientific knowledge and technological artefacts. More recently, social scientists have interrogated the emergence of ethical issues: they have documented how particular matters come to be regarded as in some way to do with 'ethics', and how this in turn enjoins particular types of social action. In sum, engagements between STS and bioethics are increasingly important in order to understand and manage the complex dynamics between science, medicine and ethics in society. In this paper, I will discuss some of this and other STS (and STS-inflected) literature and reflect on how it might complement more 'traditional' modes of bioethical enquiry. What is perhaps different in STS is its predominant emphasis on the use of case studies to produce theory, rather than testing theory using cases; however, this is perhaps a difference in perspective and approach rather than an indication of sharp boundaries between STS and (for instance) anthropology and sociology [#CITATION_TAG].","It then turns to more recent developments in STS, outlining the importance of material semiotics to important traditions within the discipline including those influenced by actor network theory, feminism, and postcolonialism.","['This paper starts by exploring the development of Science, Technology and Society (STS) in the UK in the late 1960s, emphasising its interdiciplinary roots, and comparing and contrasting it with the concerns of Sociology.', 'It notes, in consistency with the Foucauldian approach, that material semiotics implies that knowledge traditions are performative, helping to create the realities that they describe.']"

While the present theory of information has much to say about the program, with the creative properties of recursivity at its heart, we almost entirely lack a theory of the information supporting the machine. The underlying heuristics explored here is that an authentic category of reality, information, must be coupled with the standard categories, matter, energy, space and time to account for what life is. Locke's account is inadequate because of its failure  to allow any role to an agent who creates or understands the representational relation. Representation occurs mysteriously by means of mediating entities. This inadequacy becomes even more evident in contrast with Aquinas' account of the activity of mind: representation for Aquinas is an act (not an object) of mind. Descartes' conception of 'ideas' is ambivalent between act  and object; and, in examining some of the problems of his account, we shall see the importance of an intentional interpretation of representation: that it is an act of thought about some object. It is not because humans have a sign system that they can achieve 'disengagement' from any particular 'here-and-now' context: other animals also use representative items, but not in the same way as humans do. Something more is required than just the availability of some physical item which can stand in for something else. There are various kinds of signifiers - broadly speaking, those which are used wittingly and those which are  unwittingly used - and what gives a signifier its particular structure is the manner of its use. What kind of act is it, and how is it possible? Trying to match models with reality allowed scientists to progress by producing better and better adequation with reality (Danchin 1992; #CITATION_TAG).","A reading of Aquinas  also illuminates the reasons for the extreme passivity of Locke's account, since its origins are clearly to be seen in the Thomist account, but Locke's version has lost the most important feature of the Thomist account. Part II develops the issues raised earlier within the  particular context of signification and semiotic theory. The semiotic theories of Saussure, Peirce .and Piaget are examined, with occasional reference to Frege. Part II, then, deals with questions about the representative item and how it comes to represent other items.","['Part I raises the problems that will shape our investigation of representation.', 'The theme of Chapters 4 to 6 is that a signifier  is only as good as the intelligence which uses it.', 'Part III focuses on the activity of representation.', 'In Chapter 7 a distinction is made between active and passive senses of representation, and arising  out of this distinction we study the particular case of images, considered as a form of representation.']"

640,"OPINION ARTICLE published: 16 April 2013 doi: 10.3389/fpls.2013.00099 Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE Gian-Pietro Di Sansebastiano* Laboratory of Botany, DiSTeBA, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy *Correspondence: gp.disansebastiano@unisalento.it Edited by: Markus Geisler, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Reviewed by: Markus Geisler, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Frantisek Baluska, University of Bonn, Germany Giovanni Stefano, Michigan State University, USA SNAREs (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor adaptor protein receptors) have been often seen to have a dishomogeneous distribution on membranes and are apparently present in excess of the amount required to assure correct vesicle traffic. It was also shown in few cases that SNARE on the target membrane (t-SNARE) with a fusogenic role, can become non-fusogenic when overexpressed. SNARE ABUNDANCE AND INFLUENCE OF DISTRIBUTION ON THEIR FUSOGENIC ROLE SNAREs are relatively small polypeptides (~200-400-amino-acids) characterized by the presence of a particular domain, the SNARE motif (Jahn and Scheller, 2006), consisting of heptad repeats that can form a coiled-coil structure. Via heterooligomeric interactions, these proteins form highly stable protein-protein interactions organized in a SNARE-complex that help to overcome the energy barrier required for membrane fusion. Even after considering all these potential interactors, in living cells, most SNARE molecules are apparently present in excess and concentrated in clusters, thus constituting a spare pool not readily available for interactions. About the alteration of SNARE function, it is essential to remember that antibodies or recombinant SNARE fragments, showing inhibitory or dominant negative (DN) effect, for example, on syntaxin 13 (Bethani et al., 2009), induce effects that are very different: antibodies cause the depletion of active domains while SNARE fragments cause the competitive saturation of the interacting partners. SNAREs (precisely t-SNAREs) have been visualized to form apparent clusters using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. This inhomogeneous distribution was initially proposed to provide a localized pool of t-SNAREs to facilitate and enhance membranes fusion (van den Bogaart et al., 2011) but recently, using super-resolution microscopy techniques, Yang and coworkers (2012) showed that secretory vesicles were preferentially targeted to membrane areas with a low density of SNAREs. Vesicles do not preferentially target these microdomains. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro-domains and the t-SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions (Yang et al., 2012). Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (Silva et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52 a double localization associated to two different functions (De Benedictis et al., 2012). Also in Petunia hybrida, the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now (Faraco, 2011) seems to define in petal epidermal cells a very well defined vacuolar compartments separated from www.frontiersin.org April 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 99 | 1 the central vacuole and already observed with other vacuolar markers (Verweij et al., 2008). The discovery of new structural roles for SNAREs, eventually related to the interaction with still unknown partners, may shed light on vacuolar complex organization and it is not surprising that results about vacuolar SNAREs still appear contradictory. Bethani and co-workers (2009) discussed interesting points proving SNARE specificity. Little attention is generally paid to the need of the cell to keep very similar compartments separated, because this need may not be evident among endosomes as much as among larger vacuolar structures typical of only few plant cells (Epimashko et al., 2004; Verweij et al., 2008). Proteolipidic composition appears determinant (Strasser et al., 2011). From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (Strasser et al., 2011). It is extremely interesting a recent report on SNAREs interaction with proteolipid (Di Giovanni et al., 2010). It was suggested that this interaction had the effect to concentrate SNAREs in some areas to enhance their fusogenic potential but it is now evident that more regulatory events than simple localization is involved. i-SNAREs At the moment, in plants, it was observed that SYP21 (Foresti et al., 2006), SYP51, and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) inhibit vacuolar traffic when overexpressed. Varlamov and co-workers (2004) suggested that non-fusogenic SNARE complexes, including the i-SNARE partners, have the physiological function at the level of the Golgi apparatus to increase the polarity of this organelle. Mammalian and yeast i-SNAREs (syntaxin 6/Tlg1, GS15/Sft1, and rBet1/Bet1) were found functionally conserved but i-SNARE characterization in plants is still poor. A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins (Izawa et al., 2012) and because of their ability to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011). More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (Grefen et al., 2010). The speculations about the mechanism active in plant cells can include the mechanisms elucidated in yeast cells with the exception that in S. cerevisiae a single Qc-SNARE is active at each step but more than one are active in plants. Several sorting processes may be influenced by the higher concentration of specific SNAREs but the phenomena are simply not yet correlated. SNAREs can also be specifically localized and active as t-SNARE on intermediate compartments, such as for example SYP61, localized on the TGN membranes (2). The compartments indicated in the figure are generic; their identity may change in different experimental systems and in differentiated cells. pollen tubes (Wang et al., 2011) where SYP5s are expressed at higher levels than in all other tissues (Lipka et al., 2007; De Benedictis et al., 2012). The equilibrium between fusogenic (tSNARE) and non fusogenic (i-SNARE) activity of specific SNAREs may reside on their localization, as highlighted for SYP51 and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) but also on the formation of ""clusters"" in cholesterol-containing microdomains (Sieber et al., 2006, 2007). In this manuscript I discuss data obtained in various eukaryotic models that leave open different possibilities for the action mechanism of the i-SNAREs in plants. It supported the idea that a small number of SNAREs is needed to drive a single fusion event and that the proteins not engaged in classic fusion events are maintained, by yet undefined mechanisms, in membrane micro-domains with a non-random molecular composition. These have been proposed to belong to a new functional class of SNAREs (Varlamov et al., 2004). Plant sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) encoded by genes of the same sub-family are generally considered as redundant in promoting vesicle-associated membrane fusion events. Nonetheless, the application of innovative experimental approaches highlighted that members of the same gene sub-family often have different functional specificities. Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52 a double localization associated to two different functions (#CITATION_TAG).","When transiently overexpressed, the SYP51 and the SYP52 distributed between the TGN and the tonoplast.","['In this work, two closely related Qc-SNAREs--the AtSYP51 and the AtSYP52--are compared in their ability to influence different secretory pathways.']"
3,"Decision-making animals can use slow-but-accurate strategies, such as making multiple comparisons, or opt for simpler, faster strategies to find a 'good enough' option. Social animals make collective decisions about many group behaviours including foraging and migration. The key to the collective choice lies with individual behaviour. We present a case study of a collective decision-making process (house-hunting ants, Temnothorax albipennis), in which a previously proposed decision strategy involved both quality-dependent hesitancy and direct comparisons of nests by scouts. This highlights the need to carefully design experiments to detect individual comparison. This parsimonious mechanism could promote collective rationality in group decision-making. Prior studies of this decision-making process indicate that swarms attempt to use the best-of-N decision rule: sample some number (N) of alternatives and then select the best one. Although a honey bee swarm has bounded rationality (e.g., it lacks complete knowledge of the possible nesting sites), through its capacity for parallel processing it can choose a nest site without greatly reducing either the breadth or depth of its consideration of the alternative sites. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scouts initially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41], but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances are dependent on nest quality [#CITATION_TAG].","We tested how well swarms implement this decision rule by presenting them with an array of five nest boxes, only one of which was a high-quality (desirable) nest site; the other four were medium-quality (acceptable) sites. A dancing bee tunes her dance strength by adjusting the number of waggle-runs/dance, and she adjusts the number of waggle-runs/dance by changing both the duration and the rate of her waggle-run production. Differences in return-phase duration underlie the impression that dances differ in liveliness.",['This study views a honey bee swarm as a supraorganismal entity which has been shaped by natural selection to be skilled at choosing a future home site.']

Abstract In recent years, there has been a growing interest in a range of transport policy initiatives which are designed to influence people's travel behaviour away from single-occupancy car use and towards more benign and efficient options, through a combination of marketing, information, incentives and tailored new services. In transport policy discussions, these are now widely described as 'soft' factor interventions or 'smarter choice' measures or 'mobility management' tools. In 2004, the UK Department for Transport commissioned a major study to examine whether large-scale programmes of these measures could potentially deliver substantial cuts in car use.

19,"-Several studies have suggested that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), mostly omeprazole, interact with clopidogrel efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP2C19 inhibition.

PATIENTS All patients discharged after first-time myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2006.

189,"A hallmark of many an intuitionistic theory is the existence property, EP, i.e., if the theory proves an existential statement then there is a provably definable witness for it. However, there are well known exceptions, for example, the full intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, IZF, does not have the existence property, where IZF is formulated with Collection. However, in this paper it is shown that several well known intuitionistic set theories with Collection have the weak existence property. As a result, the culprit preventing the weak existence property from obtaining must consist of a combination of Collection and unbounded Separation. However, this requires a new form of ordinal analysis for theories with Power Set and Exponentiation (cf. Rathjen (2011) [39]) and is beyond the scope of the current paper. A realizability-notion akin to Kleene's slash [18, 19] was extended to various intuitionistic set theories by Myhill [27, #CITATION_TAG], whereby he also drew on work by Moschovakis [24].","The upshot is that CZF+CC+FT possesses the same strength as CZF, or more precisely, that CZF+CC+FTis conservative over CZF for 02 statements of arithmetic, whereas the addition of a restricted version of bar induction to CZF (called decidable bar induction, BID) leads to greater proof-theoretic strength in that CZF+BID proves the consistency of CZF","['The paper furnishes realizability models of constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, CZF, which also validate Brouwerian principles such as the axiom of continuous choice (CC), the fan theorem (FT), and monotone bar induction (BIM), and thereby determines the proof-theoretic strength of CZF augmented by these principles.']"
335,"Cognitive neuroscience boils down to describing the ways in which cognitive function results from brain activity. Exactly how cognitive function inherits the physical dimensions of neural activity, though, is highly non-trivial, and so are generally the corresponding dimensions of cognitive phenomena. In spite of their general use, these assumptions hold true to a high degree of approximation for many cognitive (viz. fast perceptual) processes, but have their limitations for other ones (e.g., thinking or reasoning). Classical within-subject analysis in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) relies on a detection step to localize which parts of the brain are activated by a given stimulus type. The originality of this contribution is twofold. By nature, scaling analysis requires the use of long enough signals with high frequency sampling rate. The break-down of scale invariance (Ciuciu et al., 2011 (#CITATION_TAG Zilber et al., 2012) is tantamount to velocity changes.","This is usually achieved using model-based approaches. First, we propose a synthetic, consistent, and comparative overview of the various stochastic processes and estimation procedures used to model and analyze scale invariance. Notably, it is explained how multifractal models are more versatile to adjust the scaling properties of fMRI data but require more elaborated analysis procedures. To this end, we make use of a localized 3-D echo volume imaging (EVI) technique, which has recently emerged in fMRI because it allows very fast acquisitions of successive brain volumes. A voxel-based systematic multifractal analysis has been performed over both kinds of data.","['Here, we propose an alternative exploratory analysis.']"

151,"Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to various methods of assessing the beat-to-beat variation in the heart over time, in order to draw inference on the outflow of the autonomic nervous system. Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV. Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. An academic scientist's professional success depends on publishing. Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. Likewise, recent interest in data uploading and retention (e.g., #CITATION_TAG) has received little systematic attention in cardiac psychophysiology so far, even though a) data retention is a American Psychological Association requirement (American psychological association [APA], 2001) and b) the ability to broadly access raw data is a potentially excellent control for the methodological and analytical issues outlined here, as well as a test bed for the development of future HRV metrics and meta-analysis.",,"['This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content.', 'This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases.']"

Individuals with bipolar disorder manifest the full spectrum of emotions ranging from depression to mania. The stimuli produced activation in both patients and comparison subjects in brain regions previously implicated in the generation and modulation of affect, in particular the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.

In the last decades, Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and more recently Support Vector Machines (SVM), have been proposed for TSF. In this work, we propose a novel Evolutionary SVM (ESVM) approach for TSF based on the Estimation Distribution Algorithm to search for the best number of inputs and SVM hyperparameters.

729,"INTUITIVE AND REFLECTIVE RESPONSES IN PHILOSOPHY by NICK BYRD B.A. IRB protocol #13-0678 Nick Byrd (M.A., Philosophy) INTUITIVE AND REFLECTIVE REASONING IN PHILOSOPHY Committee: Michael Huemer, Robert Rupert, and Michael Tooley Cognitive scientists have revealed systematic errors in human reasoning. There is disagreement about what these errors indicate about human rationality, but one upshot seems clear: human reasoning does not seem to fit traditional views of human rationality. This concern about rationality has made its way through various fields and has recently caught the attention of philosophers. Nonetheless, philosophers are not entirely immune to this systematic error, and their proclivity for this error is statistically related to their responses to a variety of philosophical questions. So, while the evidence herein puts constraints on the worries about the integrity of philosophy, it by no means eliminates these worries. I also owe a great deal to various faculty members in cognitive science and psychology. The concern is that if philosophers are prone to systematic errors in reasoning, then the integrity of philosophy would be threatened. In this paper, I present some of the more famous work in cognitive science that has marshaled this concern. The lack of gender parity in philosophy has garnered serious attention recently. Previous empirical work that aims to quantify what has come to be called ""the gender gap"" in philosophy focuses mainly on the absence of women in philosophy faculty and graduate programs. There are a variety of views about why this is the case, but there is some evidence that implicit bias at various stages in the undergraduate, graduate, and career-level training and selection processes could result in fewer opportunities for advancement for women (#CITATION_TAG Tiberius 2012, Stier and Yaish 2014).","First, the biggest drop in the proportion of women in philosophy occurs between students enrolled in introductory philosophy classes and philosophy majors.","['Our study looks at gender representation in philosophy among undergraduate students, undergraduate majors, graduate students, and faculty.']"
808,"Although general anesthetics are thought to modify critical neuronal functions, their impact on neuronal communication has been poorly examined. We have investigated the effect induced by desflurane, a clinically used general anesthetic, on information transfer at the synapse between mossy fibers and granule cells of cerebellum, where this analysis can be carried out extensively. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic change supposed to provide the cellular basis for learning and memory in brain neuronal circuits. Although specific LTP expression mechanisms could be critical to determine the dynamics of repetitive neurotransmission, this important issue remained largely unexplored. A mathematical model of mossy fiber-granule cell neurotransmission showed that increasing release probability efficiently modulated the first-spike delay. Independent regulation of spike burst initiation and frequency during LTP may provide mechanisms for temporal recoding and gain control of afferent signals at the input stage of cerebellar cortex Whole-cell recordings from GrCs were obtained with patch-clamp technique [20, 29, #CITATION_TAG] by using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA) (-3dB; cut-off frequency = 2 kHz).","In agreement with a presynaptic expression caused by increased release probability, similar changes were observed by raising extracellular [Ca(2+)].

919,"The eolian sand depositional record for a dune field within Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts is posit as a sensitive indicator of environmental disturbances in the late Holocene from a combination of factors such as hurricane/storm and forest fire occurrence, and anthropogenic activity. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic observations, particularly the burial of Spodosol-like soils, and associated C and OSL ages that are concordant indicate at least six eolian depositional events at ca. 3750, 2500, 1800, 960, 430, and <250 years ago. The two oldest events are documented at just one locality and thus, the pervasiveness of this eolian activity is unknown. Thus, local droughts are not associated with periods of dune movement in this mesic environment. Latest eolian activity on outer Cape Cod commenced in the past 300-500 years and may reflect multiple factors including broad-scale landscape disturbance with European colonization, an increased incidence of forest fires and heightened storminess. Eolian systems of Cape Cod appear to be sensitive to landscape disturbance and prior to European settlement may reflect predominantly hurricane/storm disturbance, despite generally mesic conditions in past 4 ka.

223,"First, there was excessive maturity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehicles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. In thinking about regulatory reform, one must therefore go beyond considerations of individual incentives and supervision and pay attention to issues of systemic interdependence and transparency. The paper analyses the causes of the current crisis of the global financial system, with particular emphasis on the systemic elements that turned the crisis of subprime mortgage-backed securities in the United States, a small part of the overall system, into a worldwide crisis. The paper argues that these developments have not only been caused by identifiably faulty decisions, but also by flaws in financial system architecture. The global financial crisis (GFC) caused catastrophic losses in the highly regulated banking sector. In contrast, the largely unregulated global hedge fund industry navigated through the crisis relatively unscathed. As a consequence of the GFC, there is the tidal wave of opinion calling for reform of the global financial architecture, with a specific emphasis on tightened oversight of hedge funds. 88 For theoretical treatments of the problem, see Carletti (2006, 2008), #CITATION_TAG (2006). 89 International Monetary Fund (2008a, pp. 65f).",,"['In this article, we consider the debate regarding the future of hedge fund regulation, building the case that regulatory reform to constrain excessive leverage must be applied in equal measure to all financial market participants, not just hedge funds.', 'The challenge for regulators is to carefully craft a regime of transparency and disclosure which minimises the potential for systemic risk without jeopardising the financial innovation and entrepreneurship that is emblematic of the hedge fund sector.Griffith Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and EconomicsFull Tex']"

Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. The diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy frequently depends on results of tests which elicit reflex changes in heart rate. Few well-documented normal ranges are available for these tests.

129,"Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk obtained through bioclimatic envelope models calibrated with native species distribution data can play a critical role in invasive species management. Forecasts of invasion risk to novel environments, however, remain controversial. Only when incorporating a measure of human modification of habitats within the native range do bioclimatic envelope models yield credible predictions of invasion risk for parakeets across Europe. Invasion risk derived from models that account for differing niche requirements of phylogeographic lineages and those that do not achieve similar statistical accuracy, but there are pronounced differences in areas predicted to be susceptible for invasion. Aim To mitigate the threat invasive species pose to ecosystem functioning, reliable risk assessment is paramount. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km(2)  to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere. Climate influences species distributions directly through species' physiological tolerances or indirectly through its effect on available habitats, food resources and biotic interactions such as the presence of competitors (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012, #CITATION_TAG.","In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution.","['Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales.']"

This was at the time when Vienna became the permanent residence of the Holy Roman Empire (except from 1583 to 1611 when it was moved to Prague), due to the Habsburgs holding the crown. Vienna was also the capital of the so-called Danube Monarchy, which came into being in the early sixteenth century.

This is a complex exercise that requires characterising with a high precision the topics of thousands of books and matching them with the interests of the relevant communities. In Springer Nature, this task has been traditionally handled manually by publishing editors. However, the rapid growth in the number of scientific publications and the dynamic nature of the Computer Science landscape has made this solution increasingly inefficient. We have addressed this issue by creating Smart Book Recommender (SBR), an ontologybased recommender system developed by The Open University (OU) in collaboration with Springer Nature, which supports their Computer Science editorial team in selecting the products to market at specific venues.

912,"The eolian sand depositional record for a dune field within Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts is posit as a sensitive indicator of environmental disturbances in the late Holocene from a combination of factors such as hurricane/storm and forest fire occurrence, and anthropogenic activity. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic observations, particularly the burial of Spodosol-like soils, and associated C and OSL ages that are concordant indicate at least six eolian depositional events at ca. 3750, 2500, 1800, 960, 430, and <250 years ago. The two oldest events are documented at just one locality and thus, the pervasiveness of this eolian activity is unknown. Thus, local droughts are not associated with periods of dune movement in this mesic environment. Latest eolian activity on outer Cape Cod commenced in the past 300-500 years and may reflect multiple factors including broad-scale landscape disturbance with European colonization, an increased incidence of forest fires and heightened storminess. Eolian systems of Cape Cod appear to be sensitive to landscape disturbance and prior to European settlement may reflect predominantly hurricane/storm disturbance, despite generally mesic conditions in past 4 ka. Numerous geomorphic studies along coasts of the European North Atlantic implicate increased storminess in the Holocene with the reactivation of coastal dune system (e.g., Clarke and Rendell, 2009; #CITATION_TAG).","We demonstrate how to create artificial external non-Abelian gauge potentials acting on cold atoms in optical lattices.

Tensor models can be interpreted as theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces. It is found that the momentum distribution of the low-lying low-momentum spectra is in agreement with that of the metric tensor modulo the general coordinate transformation in the general relativity at least in the dimensions studied numerically, i.e. 18, and the subsequent studies mainly in numerical methods have supported the validity of this basic idea [19] [#CITATION_TAG] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26].",,"['In this paper, I study numerically the fluctuation spectra around a Gaussian classical solution of a tensor model, which represents a fuzzy flat space in arbitrary dimensions.']"
745,"Phonological errors were scarce in both groups. In order for such comparisons to be meaningful, however, the instruments used to measure the theoretical constructs of interest have to exhibit adequate cross-national equivalence. For example, closed class words are semantically 'shallow', having fewer semantic features than open class items, which could make them more vulnerable to damage within the semantic system or between semantics and word form representations (Allen & Seidenberg, 1999; Goodglass & Menn, 1985; #CITATION_TAG).","We review the various forms of measurement invariance that have been proposed in the literature, organize them into a coherent conceptual framework that ties different requirements of measure equivalence to the goals of the research, and propose a practical, sequential testing procedure for assessing measurement invariance in cross-national consumer research.

469,"This paper offers a short history of routine clinical outcomes measurement (RCOM) in UK mental health services. Within the general embrace of a health service ""free at the point of access"", the United Kingdom (UK) has no single national health service (NHS). Scotland, Northern Ireland and, since 2001, Wales have separate arrangements for health service policy, management and delivery. In Scotland there is no mandated or national system for RCOM, although large patient outcomes surveys have been carried out. In Wales and Scotland ""outcomes frameworks"" have been developed to measure the impact of policies on the mental health of the whole population, for instance the average scores of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS: see Table 1 ) (Tennant et al., 2007) from the Scottish Health Survey. In Northern Ireland the emphasis has been on measuring mental health recovery, but without yet clear agreement of how this can be done. What follows therefore predominately relates to England. Of great importance in the use of rating scales in any context are their psychometric properties. There have been relatively few studies in UK clinical populations of psychometric properties of measures coming into widespread use, such as the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales. One reason for this could be an assumption that once the properties are established in one population, that this is likely to generalise to others. However, contexts can vary, and just as randomised controlled trials of treatments need to be replicated in different settings, so too should evaluations of psychometric properties. Given the breadth of measures and scarcity of relevant evidence, psychometric properties are not provided in this paper. Mental Health services in the UK and their patients Services are provided by the NHS in primary care settings (often but not always involving initial contact with general medical practitioners), in secondary specialist mental health services (usually after referral from general practitioner), and in tertiary services such as secure forensic milieus (Deakin & Bhugra, 2012) . Most mental health issues occur in and are dealt with in primary care (King et al., 2008) , either through informal self-funded counselling, private psychotherapy services, charitable organisations e.g., for relationship or bereavement problems, or funded counselling services attached to general practices, schools, colleges, universities and some workplaces. Depressive and anxiety disorders predominate. Severe mental illness is usually initially treated in secondary care by state-funded NHS services, but few with short-term illnesses such as major depressive or bipolar disorder and only a small proportion of patients with chronic severe illness remain in secondary caremany are discharged back into the care of their general practitioner once any acute phase has passed. Secondary care is community-orientated with patients assessed and treated in Introduction: Definitions and circumspections Routine clinical outcomes measurement (RCOM) is taken here to mean the measurement of health status change (i.e., between at least two points in time) in a service-user population, usually with the intention of inferring how muchor littleclinical interventions have helped. Priebe et al (#CITATION_TAG) has reported the results of subjective quality of life items in DIALOG (see Table 1), a structured communication tool in mental health services.","Abstract Background DIALOG is an intervention to structure the communication between patient and key worker, which has been shown to improve patient outcomes in community mental health care. As part of the intervention, patients provide ratings of their subjective quality of life (SQOL) on eight Likert type items and their treatment satisfaction on three such items. Method Data were taken from 271 patients who received the DIALOG intervention. All patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia or a related disorder and treated in community mental health care. For SQOL and treatment satisfaction as assessed in the DIALOG intervention, we established the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), the convergent validity of SQOL items (correlation with Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life [MANSA]) and treatment satisfaction items (correlation with Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ]), the concurrent validity (correlations with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]) and the sensitivity to change (t-test comparing ratings of the first and last intervention). We also explored the factorial structure of the eight SQOL items. SQOL items loaded on two meaningful factors, one capturing health and personal safety and one reflecting other life domains.",['This study explored the psychometric qualities of the outcome data generated in the DIALOG intervention to explore whether they may be used for evaluating treatment outcomes.']
308,"Major academic publishers need to be able to analyse their vast catalogue of products and select the best items to be marketed in scientific venues. This is a complex exercise that requires characterising with a high precision the topics of thousands of books and matching them with the interests of the relevant communities. In Springer Nature, this task has been traditionally handled manually by publishing editors. However, the rapid growth in the number of scientific publications and the dynamic nature of the Computer Science landscape has made this solution increasingly inefficient. We have addressed this issue by creating Smart Book Recommender (SBR), an ontologybased recommender system developed by The Open University (OU) in collaboration with Springer Nature, which supports their Computer Science editorial team in selecting the products to market at specific venues. Recommender systems have the effect of guiding users in a personalized  way to interesting objects in a large space of possible options. Content-based  recommendation systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has  liked in the past. Indeed, the basic process performed by a content-based recommender  consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile in which preferences  and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item), in order to  recommend to the user new interesting items. Content-based recommender systems [#CITATION_TAG] rely on a pre-existing domain knowledge to suggest items more similar to the ones that the user seems to like.","The first part of the chapter presents the basic concepts and terminology of contentbased  recommender systems, a high level architecture, and their main advantages  and drawbacks.

The most widely adopted techniques for learning user profiles are also presented. The last part of the chapter discusses trends and future research which might lead  towards the next generation of systems, by describing the role of User Generated  Content as a way for taking into account evolving vocabularies, and the challenge  of feeding users with serendipitous recommendations, that is to say surprisingly  interesting items that they might not have otherwise discovered","['This chapter provides an overview of  content-based recommender systems, with the aim of imposing a degree of order on  the diversity of the different aspects involved in their design and implementation.']"

23,"-Several studies have suggested that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), mostly omeprazole, interact with clopidogrel efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP2C19 inhibition. Whether this occurs with all PPIs is a matter of debate. Patients receiving dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel are commonly treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Attenuating effects on platelet response to clopidogrel have been reported solely for the PPI omeprazole.

756,"Despite the established importance of buyer-seller relationships in B-to-B markets, research to determine the differential effects that keep suppliers and customers in a relationship has been scarce. Only with regard to relational tolerance and only for buyers do switching costs play a greater role than relationship value. Referring to transaction cost analysis, this study investigates how switching costs and relationship value as perceived by each side unfold their bonding forces in such a relationship. The demand for aggregation in evaluating managerial performance arises because reporting all the basic transactions and other nonfinancial information about performance is costly and impracticable (see Ashton [1982], Casey [1978], and Holmstrom and Milgrom [1987]). A buyer generally tries to avoid dependence on a particular supplier (#CITATION_TAG) but companies today tend to trade in some of their independence against cost savings by having fewer, heavily bound, high value suppliers (Swift & Coe, 1994).","We identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the joint density function of the signals under which linear aggregation, a simple and commonly employed way to construct a performance evaluation measure, is optimal.

502,"Previous research has shown that people form impressions of potential leaders from their faces and that certain facial features predict success in reaching prestigious leadership positions. However, much less is known about the accuracy or meta-accuracy of face-based leadership inferences. Here we examine a simple, but important, question: Can leadership domain be inferred from faces? However, people are surprisingly bad at evaluating their own performance on this judgment task: We find no relationship between how well judges think they performed and their actual accuracy levels. Recent research has shown that rapid judgments about the personality traits of political candidates, based solely on their appearance, can predict their electoral success. This suggests that voters rely heavily on appearances when choosing which candidate to elect. Yet, the human mind often relies on superficial cues to form judgments or make decisions, and the choice of which leader to select is no exception: A large and growing literature shows that facial appearances predict success in reaching prestigious leadership positions (Antonakis & Jacquart, 2013; #CITATION_TAG).","We also reanalyze previous data to show that facial competence is a highly robust and specific predictor of political preferences.

60,"Solar radiation and ambient temperature have acted as selective physical forces among populations and thereby guided species distributions in the globe. Circadian clocks are universal and evolve when subjected to selection, and their properties contribute to variations in fitness within specific environments. Because of their position in the hierarchy and repressive actions, cryptochromes are the key components of the feedback loops on which circadian clocks are built. Sleep deprivation (SD) results in increased electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and is associated with changes in the expression of circadian clock-related genes in the cerebral cortex. The increase of NREMS delta power as a function of previous wake duration varies among inbred mouse strains. It is strengthened further by those which show that the CRY2 gene expression is abnormal when inbred-strain mice with the intrinsic level of high anxiety are deprived of sleep (#CITATION_TAG), and when humans with bipolar type 1 disorder do remain depressed after the antidepressant sleep deprivation (Lavebratt et al., 2010).","Cortical expression of clock genes subsequent to SD was proportional to the increase in delta power that occurs in inbred strains: the strain that exhibits the most robust EEG response to SD (AKR/J) exhibited dramatic increases in expression of bmal1, clock, cry2, csnkIepsilon, and npas2, whereas the strain with the least robust response to SD (DBA/2) exhibited either no change or a decrease in expression of these genes and cry1.",['We sought to determine whether SD-dependent changes in circadian clock gene expression parallel this strain difference described previously at the EEG level.']

623,"In cognitive archeology, theories of cognition are used to guide interpretation of archeological evidence. But the implications that archeology has for cognitive science particularly relate to traditional proposals from the field involving modular decomposition, symbolic thought and the mediating role of language. There is a need to make a connection with more recent approaches, which more strongly emphasize information, probabilistic reasoning and exploitation of embodiment. Proposals from cognitive archeology, in which evolution of cognition is seen to involve a transition to symbolic thought need to be realigned with theories from cognitive science that no longer give symbolic reasoning a central role. The present paper develops an informational approach, in which the transition is understood to involve cumulative development of information-rich generalizations. Where it once emphasized the importance of representational multiplicity and centralized integration (e.g. #CITATION_TAG; Gregory, 1984) it now gives as much weight to exploitation of scaffolding and embodiment (e.g. Wheeler, 1994; Beer, 2000). And where it once committed to symbolic reasoning being the medium of high-level integration (e.g. Marr, 1977; Boden, 1977; Winston, 1984) it increasingly recognizes the greater potential (and neural plausibility) of probabilistic forms (e.g. Doya et al., 2007; Chater and Oaksford, 2009; Clark, 2008).","The description of the main components and mechanisms of the architecture is followed by a discussion of several domains where CHREST has already been successfully applied, such as the psychology of expert behaviour, the acquisition of language by children, and the learning of multiple representations in physics.

Academics may have a 'philosophy of teaching', but in many cases even this may not be consciously held or successfully implemented.

Three types of fixed costs are considered and experimented upon. Solution techniques for location-allocation problems usually are not a part of microcomputer-based geoprocessing systems because of the large volumes of data to process and store and the complexity of algorithms. In Type II and Type III, the fixed costs were generated from discrete uniform distributions in the range of [2, #CITATION_TAG] for 50 fixed points, [50, 400] for 287 fixed points, [1000, 10000] for 654 fixed points, and [10000, 100000] for 1060 fixed points, see Luis (2008) for more details.","The strategies used, preprocessing interpoint distance data as both candidate and demand strings, and use of them to update an allocation table, allow the solution of large problems (3000 nodes) in a microcomputer-based, interactive decisionmaking environment.

One of the most influencing reasons for this problem is the lack of novel software engineering methods and tools that can master the complexity of mobile environments. Looking at a person in a smart environment, where mobile technologies and sensors are installed to support daily activities, it is observed that informed decision-making with the help of mobile technologies is beyond what users can expect from current software services.

871,"Knowing the prevalence and characteristics of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in adolescents is important for estimations of need for mental health care and assessment of psychosis risk. Over the years, the prevalence of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) have been documented across the lifespan in varied contexts, and with a range of potential long-term outcomes. Initially the emphasis focused on whether AVHs conferred risk for psychosis. However, recent research has identified significant differences in the presentation and outcomes of AVH in patients compared to those in non-clinical populations. For this reason, it has been suggested that auditory hallucinations are an entity by themselves and not necessarily indicative of transition along the psychosis continuum. In children, need for care depends upon whether the child associates the voice with negative beliefs, appraisals and other symptoms of psychosis. For example, the existence of maladaptive coping strategies in patient populations is one significant difference between clinical and non-clinical groups which is associated with a need for care. Whether or not these mechanisms start out the same and have differential trajectories is not yet evidenced. Furthermore, childhood trauma and childhood sexual abuse is more often experienced by females (Janssen et al., 2004; Molnar et al., 2001) and is also one of the strongest risk factors for developing clinically impairing AVH and psychotic symptoms (Daalman et al., 2012; #CITATION_TAG; Janssen et al., 2004).","The stages described include childhood, adolescence, adult non-clinical populations, hypnagogic/hypnopompic experiences, high schizotypal traits, schizophrenia, substance induced AVH, AVH in epilepsy, and AVH in the elderly. This includes features of the voices such as the negative content, frequency, and emotional valence as well as anxiety and depression, independently or caused by voices presence.","['This review will examine the presentation of auditory hallucinations across the life span, as well as in various clinical groups.']"

Abstract Recognition of the importance of land-use history and its legacies in most ecological systems has been a major factor driving the recent focus on human activity as a legitimate and essential subject of environmental science. Ecologists, conservationists, and natural resource policymakers now recognize that the legacies of land-use activities continue to influence ecosystem structure and function for decades or centuries--or even longer--after those activities have ceased. As a result, environmental history emerges as an integral part of ecological science and conservation planning.

408,"Synthetic biology aims at reconstructing life to put to the test the limits of our understanding. The use of this still elusive category permits us to interact with reality via construction of self-consistent models producing predictions which can be instantiated into experiments. While the present theory of information has much to say about the program, with the creative properties of recursivity at its heart, we almost entirely lack a theory of the information supporting the machine. The underlying heuristics explored here is that an authentic category of reality, information, must be coupled with the standard categories, matter, energy, space and time to account for what life is. It is argued that the account of Savage-Rumbaugh's ape language research in Savage-Rumbaugh, Shanker and Taylor (1998. Apes, Language and the Human Mind. Oxford University Press, Oxford) is profitably read in the terms of the theoretical perspective developed in Clark (1997.

921,"It draws upon recent social and archaeological theory around embodied memory; in particular, Connerton's (1989) division of memory claims into three kinds. It is argued that cognitive memory claims and habit-memory should be regarded as aspects of the same process of remembering; following Gell (1998) and Jones (2007), physical traces of past action are regarded as central to this act of memory. It is argued that all three share some of the attributes of a ritual performance. This article is concerned with archaeological evidence for the mechanisms by which group memory is transmitted. In general, a classical solution in a tensor model may be physically regarded as a background space, and small fluctuations about the solution as emergent fields on the space. The numerical analyses of the tensor models possessing Gaussian classical background solutions have shown that the low-lying long-wavelength fluctuations around the backgrounds are in one-to-one correspondence with the geometric fluctuations on flat spaces in the general relativity. It has also been shown that part of the orthogonal symmetry of the tensor model spontaneously broken by the backgrounds can be identified with the local translation symmetry of the general relativity. Human remains occur over a long timescale at many prehistoric cave sites, particularly from the Neolithic onwards (Chamberlain, 1996; #CITATION_TAG; Leach, 2008; Schulting, 2007).","Thus the tensor model provides an interesting model of simultaneous emergence of space, the general relativity, and its local gauge symmetry of translation.","[""This paper gives a summary of the author's works concerning the emergent general relativity in a particular class of tensor models, which possess Gaussian classical solutions.""]"
233,"Because accurate diagnosis lies at the heart of medicine, it is important to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic tests. One particularly widely used measure is the AUC, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This measure has a well-understood weakness when comparing ROC curves which cross. However, it also has the more fundamental weakness of failing to balance different kinds of misdiagnosis effectively. This is not merely an aspect of the inevitable arbitrariness in choosing a performance measure, but is a core property of the way the AUC is defined.

It was also shown in few cases that SNARE on the target membrane (t-SNARE) with a fusogenic role, can become non-fusogenic when overexpressed. SNARE ABUNDANCE AND INFLUENCE OF DISTRIBUTION ON THEIR FUSOGENIC ROLE SNAREs are relatively small polypeptides (~200-400-amino-acids) characterized by the presence of a particular domain, the SNARE motif (Jahn and Scheller, 2006), consisting of heptad repeats that can form a coiled-coil structure. Via heterooligomeric interactions, these proteins form highly stable protein-protein interactions organized in a SNARE-complex that help to overcome the energy barrier required for membrane fusion. Even after considering all these potential interactors, in living cells, most SNARE molecules are apparently present in excess and concentrated in clusters, thus constituting a spare pool not readily available for interactions. About the alteration of SNARE function, it is essential to remember that antibodies or recombinant SNARE fragments, showing inhibitory or dominant negative (DN) effect, for example, on syntaxin 13 (Bethani et al., 2009), induce effects that are very different: antibodies cause the depletion of active domains while SNARE fragments cause the competitive saturation of the interacting partners. SNAREs (precisely t-SNAREs) have been visualized to form apparent clusters using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. This inhomogeneous distribution was initially proposed to provide a localized pool of t-SNAREs to facilitate and enhance membranes fusion (van den Bogaart et al., 2011) but recently, using super-resolution microscopy techniques, Yang and coworkers (2012) showed that secretory vesicles were preferentially targeted to membrane areas with a low density of SNAREs. Vesicles do not preferentially target these microdomains. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro-domains and the t-SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions (Yang et al., 2012). Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (Silva et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52 a double localization associated to two different functions (De Benedictis et al., 2012). Also in Petunia hybrida, the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now (Faraco, 2011) seems to define in petal epidermal cells a very well defined vacuolar compartments separated from www.frontiersin.org April 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 99 | 1 the central vacuole and already observed with other vacuolar markers (Verweij et al., 2008). The discovery of new structural roles for SNAREs, eventually related to the interaction with still unknown partners, may shed light on vacuolar complex organization and it is not surprising that results about vacuolar SNAREs still appear contradictory. Bethani and co-workers (2009) discussed interesting points proving SNARE specificity. Little attention is generally paid to the need of the cell to keep very similar compartments separated, because this need may not be evident among endosomes as much as among larger vacuolar structures typical of only few plant cells (Epimashko et al., 2004; Verweij et al., 2008). Proteolipidic composition appears determinant (Strasser et al., 2011). From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (Strasser et al., 2011). It is extremely interesting a recent report on SNAREs interaction with proteolipid (Di Giovanni et al., 2010). It was suggested that this interaction had the effect to concentrate SNAREs in some areas to enhance their fusogenic potential but it is now evident that more regulatory events than simple localization is involved. i-SNAREs At the moment, in plants, it was observed that SYP21 (Foresti et al., 2006), SYP51, and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) inhibit vacuolar traffic when overexpressed. Varlamov and co-workers (2004) suggested that non-fusogenic SNARE complexes, including the i-SNARE partners, have the physiological function at the level of the Golgi apparatus to increase the polarity of this organelle. Mammalian and yeast i-SNAREs (syntaxin 6/Tlg1, GS15/Sft1, and rBet1/Bet1) were found functionally conserved but i-SNARE characterization in plants is still poor. A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins (Izawa et al., 2012) and because of their ability to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011). More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (Grefen et al., 2010). The speculations about the mechanism active in plant cells can include the mechanisms elucidated in yeast cells with the exception that in S. cerevisiae a single Qc-SNARE is active at each step but more than one are active in plants. Several sorting processes may be influenced by the higher concentration of specific SNAREs but the phenomena are simply not yet correlated. SNAREs can also be specifically localized and active as t-SNARE on intermediate compartments, such as for example SYP61, localized on the TGN membranes (2). The compartments indicated in the figure are generic; their identity may change in different experimental systems and in differentiated cells. pollen tubes (Wang et al., 2011) where SYP5s are expressed at higher levels than in all other tissues (Lipka et al., 2007; De Benedictis et al., 2012). The equilibrium between fusogenic (tSNARE) and non fusogenic (i-SNARE) activity of specific SNAREs may reside on their localization, as highlighted for SYP51 and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) but also on the formation of ""clusters"" in cholesterol-containing microdomains (Sieber et al., 2006, 2007). In this manuscript I discuss data obtained in various eukaryotic models that leave open different possibilities for the action mechanism of the i-SNAREs in plants. It supported the idea that a small number of SNAREs is needed to drive a single fusion event and that the proteins not engaged in classic fusion events are maintained, by yet undefined mechanisms, in membrane micro-domains with a non-random molecular composition. These have been proposed to belong to a new functional class of SNAREs (Varlamov et al., 2004). In eukaryotic endomembrane systems, Qabc-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) on one membrane and R-SNARE on the opposing membrane assemble into a trans-QabcR-SNARE complex to drive membrane fusion. However, it remains ambiguous whether pairing of Qabc- and R-SNAREs mediates membrane fusion specificity. A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins (#CITATION_TAG) and because of their ability to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011).",,"['Here, we explored the fusion specificity of reconstituted proteoliposomes bearing purified SNAREs in yeast vacuoles and other organelles.']"
612,"The main problem with the state of the art in the semantic search domain is the lack of comprehensive evaluations.

914,"The eolian sand depositional record for a dune field within Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts is posit as a sensitive indicator of environmental disturbances in the late Holocene from a combination of factors such as hurricane/storm and forest fire occurrence, and anthropogenic activity. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic observations, particularly the burial of Spodosol-like soils, and associated C and OSL ages that are concordant indicate at least six eolian depositional events at ca. 3750, 2500, 1800, 960, 430, and <250 years ago. The two oldest events are documented at just one locality and thus, the pervasiveness of this eolian activity is unknown. Thus, local droughts are not associated with periods of dune movement in this mesic environment. Latest eolian activity on outer Cape Cod commenced in the past 300-500 years and may reflect multiple factors including broad-scale landscape disturbance with European colonization, an increased incidence of forest fires and heightened storminess. Eolian systems of Cape Cod appear to be sensitive to landscape disturbance and prior to European settlement may reflect predominantly hurricane/storm disturbance, despite generally mesic conditions in past 4 ka.

Tsuga canadensis and Fagus grandifolia are abundant in the upland area, while Quercus, Carya and Pinus species have higher abundances in the lowlands. Lacustrine sediment cores from the northeastern U.S. show a decline in Hemlock (Tsuga sp. ), a decrease in lake level, or an increase in clastic sedimentation ca. 5.5-3.8 ka and is associated with a broad scale drying (e.g., Newby et al., 2000; Shuman et al., 2001; Shuman and Donnelly, 2006; #CITATION_TAG; Marsicek et al., 2013).","The sites span a climatic and vegetational gradient from the lowland areas of eastern Massachusetts and Connecticut to the uplands of north-central and western Massachusetts.

849,"Choices are not only communicated via explicit actions but also passively through inaction. Additionally, the choice itself was biased towards action such that subjects tended to choose a photograph obtained by action more often than a photographed obtained through inaction. In this study we investigated how active or passive choice impacts upon the choice process itself as well as a preference change induced by choice. Subjects often rated harmful omissions as less immoral, or less bad as decisions, than harmful commissions. One possibility is this is related to an increased sense of causality and personal responsibility associated with overt actions [#CITATION_TAG].","Subjects read scenarios concerning pairs of options. One option was an omission, the other, a commission. Intentions, motives, and consequences were held constant. Subjects either judged the morality of actors by their choices or rated the goodness of decision options. Such ratings were associated with judgments that omissions do not cause outcomes. The 'omission bias ' revealed in these experiments can be described as an overgeneralization of a useful heuristic to cases in which it is not justified.","['It is based in part on undergraduate honors theses by M.

358,"Background Unassisted cessationquitting without pharmacological or professional supportis an enduring phenomenon. Unassisted cessation persists even in nations advanced in tobacco control where cessation assistance such as nicotine replacement therapy, the stop-smoking medications bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural assistance are readily available. We review the qualitative literature on the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted. Motivation, although widely reported, had only one clear meaning, that is 'the reason for quitting'. Commitment was equated to seriousness or resoluteness, was perceived as key to successful quitting, and was often used to distinguish earlier failed quit attempts from the final successful quit attempt. Commitment had different dimensions. The reality is that one needs to be motivated to prompt action to stop smoking, but this is not sufficient in and of itself to ensure that cessation is maintained. [#CITATION_TAG, 54] Motivation has been identified as critical to explaining cessation success.","METHODS Data are from three wave-to-wave transitions of the International Tobacco Control Four (ITC-4) country project. Smokers' responses at one wave were used to predict the likelihood of making an attempt and among those trying the likelihood of maintaining an attempt for at least a month at the next wave. For both outcomes, hierarchical logistic regressions were used to explore the predictive capacity of seven measures of motivation to quit smoking, controlling for a range of other known or possible predictors.",['AIM To explore whether measures of motivation to quit smoking have different predictive relationships with making quit attempts and the maintenance of those attempts.']

One of the horizons for further expansion is the delivery of personalised electronic services. In this paper, we describe the diffusion of personalised services in the Netherlands over the period 2006-2009 and investigate how and why various municipalities adopted personalised electronic services. In doing so, this article contributes to an institutional view on adoption and diffusion of innovations, in which (1) horizontal and vertical channels of persuasion and (2) human agency, rather than technological opportunity and rational cost-benefit considerations, account for actual diffusion of innovations. The role of local governments in attracting roots tourists is one of most important factors analyzed in the studies of diaspora tourism. Governments of several countries have actively sought to promote varied forms of roots tourism in order to attract members of their respective diasporas. In contrast, African American roots tourism in Brazil is marked by the almost complete inaction of the government, at both the state and federal levels. This type of tourism was initiated and continues to develop largely as the result of tourist demand, and with very little participation on the part of the state. Our hope is that, by focusing on 'agency' alongside 'structure' (Orlikowksi and Barley, 2001), more light will be shed on the process of technological and organisational change (#CITATION_TAG) such that, eventually, the diffusion of egovernment will be better understood.","The chapter also analyzes whether the left-leaning Workers' Party, then in charge of the state government, challenged the longstanding discourse of baianidade (Bahianness) that has predominantly represented blackness (in tourism and other realms) through domesticated and stereotypical images.","['This chapter analyzes the belated response of the state government of Bahia to African American tourism, examining how the inertia that dominated since the late 1970s was later replaced by a more proactive, although still inadequate, position, when the state tourism board, Bahiatursa, founded the Coordination of African Heritage Tourism to cater specifically to the African American roots tourism niche.']"

They owe their brightness to the dense confined plasma, and this review focuses on loops mostly as structures confining plasma. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered and, therefore, topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones, which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with separate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. The electron plasma frequency $\omega_{pe}$ and electron gyrofrequency $\Omega_e$ are two parameters that allow us to describe the properties of a plasma and to constrain the physical phenomena at play, for instance, whether a maser instability develops. The importance of the maser instability in coronal active regions depends on the complexity and topology of the magnetic field configurations.Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix (with 1 figure This problem emerged dramatically when the analysis of the same large loop structure observed with Yohkoh/SXT on the solar limb led to three Living Reviews in Solar Physics http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2014-4 different results depending mostly on the different ways to treat the background (Priest et al., 2000; #CITATION_TAG; Reale, 2002a).","We perform an in-depth analysis of the $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ ratio for simple theoretical and complex solar magnetic field configurations.

For the sake of comparison, we compute the ratio for bipolar magnetic fields containing a twisted flux bundle, and for four different observed active regions. We also study how $\omega_{pe}$/$\Omega_e$ is affected by the potential and non-linear force-free field models. We demonstrate that the ratio of the plasma frequency to the gyrofrequency for electrons can be estimated by this novel method combining magnetic field extrapolation techniques and hydrodynamic models.","['In this paper, we aim to show that the maser instability can exist in the solar corona.']"
507,"Background Social anxiety disorder is one of the most persistent and common anxiety disorders. Individually delivered psychological therapies are the most effective treatment options for adults with social anxiety disorder, but they are associated with high intervention costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the relative cost effectiveness of a variety of psychological and pharmacological interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with low direct costs compared to other anxiety disorders while indirect costs tend to be high. Mental comorbidities have been identified to increase costs, but the role of symptom severity is still vague.

231,"Because accurate diagnosis lies at the heart of medicine, it is important to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic tests. One particularly widely used measure is the AUC, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This measure has a well-understood weakness when comparing ROC curves which cross. However, it also has the more fundamental weakness of failing to balance different kinds of misdiagnosis effectively. This is not merely an aspect of the inevitable arbitrariness in choosing a performance measure, but is a core property of the way the AUC is defined. A great many tools have been developed for supervised clas- sification, ranging from early methods such as linear discriminant anal- ysis through to modern developments such as neural networks and sup- port vector machines. A large number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the relative superiority of these methods. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the di!erence in performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm. These and related issues are discussed further in [3, #CITATION_TAG, 5, 6].",,"['This paper argues that these comparisons often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an illu- sion.']"

913,"The eolian sand depositional record for a dune field within Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts is posit as a sensitive indicator of environmental disturbances in the late Holocene from a combination of factors such as hurricane/storm and forest fire occurrence, and anthropogenic activity. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic observations, particularly the burial of Spodosol-like soils, and associated C and OSL ages that are concordant indicate at least six eolian depositional events at ca. 3750, 2500, 1800, 960, 430, and <250 years ago. The two oldest events are documented at just one locality and thus, the pervasiveness of this eolian activity is unknown. Thus, local droughts are not associated with periods of dune movement in this mesic environment. Latest eolian activity on outer Cape Cod commenced in the past 300-500 years and may reflect multiple factors including broad-scale landscape disturbance with European colonization, an increased incidence of forest fires and heightened storminess. Eolian systems of Cape Cod appear to be sensitive to landscape disturbance and prior to European settlement may reflect predominantly hurricane/storm disturbance, despite generally mesic conditions in past 4 ka. The structure or composition of all vegetation types in the region have been shaped by past land-use, fire, or other disturbances, and vegetation patterns will con-tinue to change through time. Conservation efforts aimed at maintaining early succes-sional vegetation types may require intensive management comparable in intensity to the historical disturbances that allowed for their widespread development The current migration of dunes on Cape Cod is inferred to reflect a legacy of landscape disturbance, specifically forest clear-cutting, grazing and agricultural practices, associated with European settlement starting in the early 17th century and continuing into the 20th century (McCaffrey and Stilgoe, 1981; Rubertone, 1985; #CITATION_TAG; Eberhardt et al., 2003; Forman et al., 2008).","Methods Historical changes in land-use and land-cover across the study region were determined from historical maps and documentary sources.

116,"Research linking civic engagement to citizens' democratic values, generalized trust, cooperative norms, and so on often implicitly assumes such connections are stable over time. This article argues that, due to changes in the broader institutional environment, the engagement-values relation is likely to generally lack temporal stability. Practically everywhere one looks these days the concept of ""civil society"" is in vogue. Neo-Tocquevillean scholars argue that civil society plays a role in driving political, social, and even economic outcomes. This new conventional wisdom, however, is flawed. It is simply not true that democratic government is always strengthened, not weakened, when it faces a vigorous civil society. To know when civil society activity will take on oppositional or even antidemocratic tendencies, one needs to ground one's analyses in concrete examinations of political reality. 2 Given the importance of formal and informal institutions for governing people's behaviour (e.g., North, 1990; Thelen, 1999) and earlier findings linking the institutional environment to the development of specific types of voluntary associations (e.g., #CITATION_TAG; Kääriäinen & Lehtonen, 2006; Schofer & Fourcade-Gourinchas, 2001), it is surprising that both lines of argument ignore the socio-political and institutional environment within which the individual and the association exist.",,"[""This essay shows how a robust civil society helped scuttle the twentieth century's most critical democratic experiment, Weimar Germany.""]"

Self-regulation of cognition and behavior is an important aspect of student learning and academic performance in the classroom context (Corno & Mandinach, 1983; Corno & Rohrkemper, 1985).

1052,"It is difficult to overvalue the importance of polysaccharides for the great number of applicative fields in which they appeared. Oligosaccharides are relatively short compounds that are prepared from the longer polysaccharides or could also be found as such in nature. The potential in bioactivity of marine polysaccharides is still considered under-exploited and these molecules, including the derived oligosaccharides, are an extraordinary source of chemical diversity. Sustainable ways to access marine oligosaccharides are particularly important in view of the huge list of the effects they play in cell events; enzymatic tools, on which these sustainable ways are based, and modern techniques for purification and for the investigation of chemical structures, will be shortly discussed indicating the most important recent literature. There has been significant recent interest in the commercial utilisation of algae based on their valuable chemical constituents many of which exhibit multiple bioactivities with applications in the food, cosmetic, agri- and horticultural sectors and in human health. Compounds of particular commercial interest include pigments, lipids and fatty acids, proteins, polysaccharides and phenolics which all display considerable diversity between and within taxa. The chemical composition of natural algal populations is further influenced by spatial and temporal changes in environmental parameters including light, temperature, nutrients and salinity, as well as biotic interactions. As reported bioactivities are closely linked to specific compounds it is important to understand, and be able to quantify, existing chemical diversity and variability.

77,"Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space. Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. Tropical tree height-diameter (H:D) relationships may vary by forest type and region making large-scale estimates of above-ground biomass subject to bias if they ignore these differences in stem allometry. Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (PV), dry season length (SD), and mean annual air temperature (TA) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. The relationship between diameter and height also varies across the basin, but with more complexity than wood density, mostly related to climatic factors (#CITATION_TAG).",2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass.,"['Utilising this database, our objectives were: 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap).']"
488,"Understanding how children develop in this complex environment will require a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of how the child and environment interact-- both within and beyond the laboratory. Categories, like children, do not exist in isolation. Consequently, category learning cannot be easily separated from the learning context--nor should it be. According to a systems perspective of cognition and development, categorization emerges as the product of multiple factors combining in time (Thelen and Smith, 1994). To be as inclusive as possible, we consider any case in which a participant responds to how stimuli may be grouped as evidence of category learning. You may notice in these examples that we have not included children's ages because, according to a systems view, research should not be about age per se. Obviously, age must be taken into account in experimental design because age is generally (but not perfectly) correlated with developmental level (e.g., appropriate motor responses differ for a 2-year-old vs. 2-month-old). WHO IS INVOLVED IN LEARNING In the real world children learn through play and independent exploration (HirshPasek et al., 2009). However, in the lab children are seldom alone. This is important because children adjust their learning depending on who is providing information (e.g., the same or different experimenter, Goldenberg and Sandhofer, 2013; human or robot, O'Connell et al., 2009; mom or dad, Pancsofar and VernonFeagans, 2006). Children are also opportunistic and will look for any signal of what the right answer is. For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., Akhtar et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984). Moreover, who the child is also matters. WHAT IS BEING CATEGORIZED All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (Sloutsky, 2010). Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004; Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007). In naturalistic environments, categories are often ad hoc and flexible (Barsalou, 1983). For example, the category ""toys to pick up before bed"" may be discussed every day, but each day it may include different items. Furthermore, the process of categorizing objects is not independent of the objects themselves: different objects may be more or less flexibly assigned to www.frontiersin.org January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 1 different categories depending on the context (Mareschal and Tan, 2007) and information available (Horst et al., 2009). Where a child lives impacts what social categories they learn and the category choices they make. For example, Black Xhosa children in South Africa prefer own-race faces if they live in a primarily Black township, but prefer higher-status race faces if they live in a racially diverse city (Shutts et al., 2011). In the lab, location matters both in terms of where the child is and where the stimuli are. For example, children are more likely to learn names for non-solid substances if introduced to the gooey items in a familiar highchair context (Perry et al., 2014). For example, yes/no questions lead to a stronger shape bias than forced-choice questions (Samuelson et al., 2009), various types of feedback differentially affect learning categories with highly salient features vs. less salient features (Hammer et al., 2012) and highly variable category members facilitate category name generalization (Perry et al., 2010) whereas less variable category members facilitate category name retention (Twomey et al., 2014). Categorization does not reflect static knowledge; rather, category learning unfolds over time and is a product of nested timescales. Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (McMurray et al., 2012). That is, learning continues even on test trials--in fact, participants may not realize the shift from learning to test trials. Consequently, different behaviors are observed depending on when during the categorization process category learning is assessed (Horst et al., 2005). Category learning is a product of nested timescales including (a) the current moment (e.g., how similar the stimuli are on the current trial, Horst and Twomey, 2013), (b) the ""just previous"" past (e.g., what happens during the intertrial interval, Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007; whether stimuli on the first test trial are novel or familiar, Schoner and Thelen, 2006; and trial order effects Wilkinson et al., 2003; Vlach et al., 2008) and (c) developmental history (e.g., vocabulary level, Ellis and Oakes, 2006; Horst et al., 2009; Perry and Samuelson, 2011). Because children's behavior is never solely the product of a single timescale it is impossible to create an experiment that taps only into category learning in the moment or only knowledge children brought to the lab. For example, Kovack-Lesh et al. UNEXPECTED INFLUENCES If researchers view categorization as static knowledge, then neither the when or how should matter. Many researchers hold this view, which purports experiments are designed to test what a child knows upon arrival at the lab: trial order and trial types are largely trivial. Small variations in what children experience during category learning can have dramatic impact on how they form categories (e.g., sequential vs. simultaneous presentation, Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Lawson, 2014) and differences in testing contexts can lead to indications of what has been learned (Cohen and Marks, 2002). Subtle experimental design decisions, such as the number of test trials to include, may not seem theoretically significant, but they can have profound effects on children's behavior. As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (Axelsson and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Samuelson et al., 2007). For example, how broadly participants generalize a category label depends on where the exemplars are presented and if the exemplars are visible simultaneously (Spencer et al., 2011). In particular whether more or less diverse examples occur in the first block of trials influences later generalization (see Spencer et al., 2011, Supplementary Materials). Unexpected influences may not be of immediate theoretical interest to a given experimenter, but they are still often informative--even at times vital-- to the underlying processes at work (e.g., the influence of novelty on children's selection is informative for understanding how prior memory influences current learning). We recognize this can be impractical with populations that are costly to recruit, in which case such factors may Frontiers in Psychology | Cognition January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 2 be controlled for statistically, for example with item-level analyses. OUTLOOK Category learning unfolds across both space and time, and small differences at one moment (e.g., shared features among the stimuli; whether exemplars are identical) can create a ripple of effects on real behavior. Behavior emerges from the combination of many factors, including those not explicitly manipulated or controlled by the experimenter. However, just as it is important to acknowledge these unexpected influences, we must not fail to see the forest for the trees. If a behavior such as category learning can only be captured in an ideal environment under carefully-controlled conditions, how much can we generalize to the contexts in which learning typically occurs? Theoretical accounts that neglect the rich influence of context in real time are too narrow to be applied outside the lab (Simmering and Perone, 2013). What we as researchers are ultimately trying to understand is how learning occurs in a real, cluttered world across time and a variety of contexts. Consequently, a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of cognitive development will require understanding how the child (or adult) and environment interact. In this paper, we include many different types of behaviors under the umbrella term ""categorization."" Our goal is not to create a catalog of milestones; our goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms driving change. Our point, however, is that we will learn more about category learning if we stop asking questions such as ""how do prototype representations compare between 6 and 8 months of age?"" Thus, in order to understand the process of categorization, researchers must ensure that the results they find in the lab are not too closely tied to the specific stimuli. Thus, it is vital to acknowledge the impact of such unexpected influences if we want to understand how categorization unfolds over time. Recent research on early word learning suggests that children's behavior when-generalizing novel nouns integrates their prior vocabulary knowledge with the specifics of the task. Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (#CITATION_TAG; Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004; Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007).","In ***1 condition, we used a combination of training and stimulus factors predicted to produce a bias to generalize nouns by shape similarity. We then reduced this shape bias and amplified a bias to generalize nouns by material similarity via manipulations of training and stimuli across 3 other conditions.",['This study examines how these factors interact on the moment-to-moment time scale of the training children receive and the sequence of stimuli they are shown.']
86,"EEG abnormalities have been reported for both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although it has been suggested that variations in mean EEG frequency are greater in the former, the existence of meaningful differences remains controversial. No evidence is as yet available for Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). If revised consensus criteria for DLB diagnosis are properly applied (i.e. All patients received a full neurological, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and neuropsychiatric evaluation, as reported in Online Resource 1, and as described in previous studies on the same cohort [#CITATION_TAG] [30] [31] [32].","To improve clinical diagnostic accuracy, special emphasis was placed on identifying cognitive fluctuations and REM-sleep behaviour disorder. EEG variability was assessed by mean frequency analysis and compressed spectral arrays (CSA) in order to detect changes over time from different scalp derivations. Graded according to the presence of alpha activity, five different patterns were identified on EEG CSA from posterior derivations. A pattern with dominant alpha bands was observed in patients with AD alone while, in those with DLB and PDD, the degree to which residual alpha and 5.6-7.9 bands appeared was related to the presence and severity of cognitive fluctuations. Of interest, in four patients initially labelled as having AD, in whom the occurrence of fluctuations and/or REM-sleep behaviour disorder during the 2-year follow-up had made the diagnosis of AD questionable, the initial EEG was characterized by the features observed in the DLB group. emphasizing the diagnostic weight of fluctuations and REM sleep behaviour disorder), EEG recording may act to support discrimination between AD and DLB at the earliest stages of dementia, since characteristic abnormalities may even precede the appearance of distinctive clinical features.","['The aim of this study was to evaluate whether EEG abnormalities can discriminate between DLB, AD and PDD in the earliest stages of dementia and to do this 50 DLB, 50 AD and 40 PDD patients with slight cognitive impairment at first visit (MMSE > or = 20) were studied.']"
101,"Most existing Information Technology (IT) adoption models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) only consider individual behaviour and views on technology adoption, without providing mechanisms to accommodate multiple stakeholder perspectives in an organization. In this paper we propose an IT adoption framework, expected to assist an organization in resolving problem situations from multiple perspectives. Irrigation farmers in the lower reaches of the Vaal and Riet Rivers are experiencing substantial yield reductions in certain crops and more profitable crops have been withdrawn from production, hypothesised, as a result of generally poor but especially fluctuating water quality. Leaching is justified financially and there is a strong motivation for a change in the current water pricing system.

232,"Because accurate diagnosis lies at the heart of medicine, it is important to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic tests. One particularly widely used measure is the AUC, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This measure has a well-understood weakness when comparing ROC curves which cross. However, it also has the more fundamental weakness of failing to balance different kinds of misdiagnosis effectively. This is not merely an aspect of the inevitable arbitrariness in choosing a performance measure, but is a core property of the way the AUC is defined. Different measures will yield different results, and it follows that it is crucial to match the measure to the true objectives. These and related issues are discussed further in [3, 4, #CITATION_TAG, 6].","In predictive data mining, algorithms will be both optimized and compared using a measure of predictive performance. We define two measures, one based on minimizing the overall cost to the card company, and the other based on minimizing the amount of fraud given the maximum number of investigations the card company can afford to make.

470,"This paper offers a short history of routine clinical outcomes measurement (RCOM) in UK mental health services. Within the general embrace of a health service ""free at the point of access"", the United Kingdom (UK) has no single national health service (NHS). Scotland, Northern Ireland and, since 2001, Wales have separate arrangements for health service policy, management and delivery. In Scotland there is no mandated or national system for RCOM, although large patient outcomes surveys have been carried out. In Wales and Scotland ""outcomes frameworks"" have been developed to measure the impact of policies on the mental health of the whole population, for instance the average scores of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS: see Table 1 ) (Tennant et al., 2007) from the Scottish Health Survey. In Northern Ireland the emphasis has been on measuring mental health recovery, but without yet clear agreement of how this can be done. What follows therefore predominately relates to England. Of great importance in the use of rating scales in any context are their psychometric properties. There have been relatively few studies in UK clinical populations of psychometric properties of measures coming into widespread use, such as the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales. One reason for this could be an assumption that once the properties are established in one population, that this is likely to generalise to others. However, contexts can vary, and just as randomised controlled trials of treatments need to be replicated in different settings, so too should evaluations of psychometric properties. Given the breadth of measures and scarcity of relevant evidence, psychometric properties are not provided in this paper. Mental Health services in the UK and their patients Services are provided by the NHS in primary care settings (often but not always involving initial contact with general medical practitioners), in secondary specialist mental health services (usually after referral from general practitioner), and in tertiary services such as secure forensic milieus (Deakin & Bhugra, 2012) . Most mental health issues occur in and are dealt with in primary care (King et al., 2008) , either through informal self-funded counselling, private psychotherapy services, charitable organisations e.g., for relationship or bereavement problems, or funded counselling services attached to general practices, schools, colleges, universities and some workplaces. Depressive and anxiety disorders predominate. Severe mental illness is usually initially treated in secondary care by state-funded NHS services, but few with short-term illnesses such as major depressive or bipolar disorder and only a small proportion of patients with chronic severe illness remain in secondary caremany are discharged back into the care of their general practitioner once any acute phase has passed. Secondary care is community-orientated with patients assessed and treated in Introduction: Definitions and circumspections Routine clinical outcomes measurement (RCOM) is taken here to mean the measurement of health status change (i.e., between at least two points in time) in a service-user population, usually with the intention of inferring how muchor littleclinical interventions have helped. Purpose Commissioning has been a central plank of health and social are policy in England for many years now, yet there are still debates about how effective it is in delivering improvements in care and outcomes. Social inclusion of people with experience of mental health is one of the goals that commissioners would like to help services to improve but such a complex outcome for people can often be undermined by contractual arrangements that fragment service responses rather than deliver holistic support. In the UK, however, the word ""outcomes"" has recently been heard at every level of government (#CITATION_TAG) and, as ever imperfectly translated into action or actual resources, it is helping drive the RCOM process forwards, as is excitement about ""value"" (Porter et al., 2006).",Design/methodology/approach The paper is a conceptual discussion and case description of the use of Alliance Contracts to improve recovery services and social inclusion in mental health care in one locality.,"['In this paper we discuss a form of commissioning, Alliance Contracting, and how it has been allied with a Social Inclusion Outcomes Framework (SIOF)in Stockport to begin to improve services and outcomes.']"
685,"Increasing college participation rates, and diversity in student population, is posing a challenge to colleges in their attempts to facilitate learners achieve their full academic potential. Learning analytics is an evolving discipline with capability for educational data analysis that could enable better understanding of learning process, and therefore mitigate these challenges. This study reviewed factors that could be used to predict academic performance, but which are currently not systematically measured in tertiary education. It focused on psychometric factors of ability, personality, motivation, and learning strategies. INTRODUCTION The manner in which students are admitted for third level education and in particular the points system have become matters of increasing public controversy in recent years. While the subject is understandably emotive, a sad feature of many of the arguments presented to date has been the very limited factual support. A student who passes this examination has certainly been fully accepted by the university in accordance with its own criteria for assessment and any subsequent failure to graduate is indicative of faults in this assessment rather than any pre-university assessments. Such analyses cannot, of course, provide definitive answers to many important questions concerning entry to third level, as many of these are essentially political in character. SOME RELATED WORK 2.1 The literature on the predictive value of school leaving, scholastic aptitude and related tests for subsequent university performance is immense. Virtually all of this work has been undertaken outside Ireland and the only detailed research published in the Irish context has been Nevin (1974). Factors affecting academic performance have been the focus of research for many years (Farsides & Woodfield, 2003; Lent, Brown, & Hacket, 1994; #CITATION_TAG).",The restriction to first year has also the important advantage of allowing the analysis of very recent university and school examinations to be presented. Our review of such work will be confined to what we consider most relevant and useful in the Irish context.,"['Our purpose in this paper is threefold: firstly to introduce some research which has and is being carried out at University College Cork on the effectiveness of performance in the Leaving Certificate examination and in such alternatives as scholastic aptitude and personality tests, as measures of subsequent university performance; secondly, to suggest some statistical methodology for the analysis of data in this area; and thirdly to offer some personal comments on aspects of the overall problem in an effort to establish a fair and hopefully constructive viewpoint and to redress some misconceptions.']"
716,"Many energy system optimization studies show that hydrogen may be an important part of an optimal decarbonisation mix, but such analyses are unable to examine the uncertainties associated with breaking the 'locked-in' nature of incumbent systems. Uncertainties around technical learning rates; consumer behaviour; and the strategic interactions of governments, automakers and fuel providers are particularly acute. System dynamics and agent-based models, and studies of historical alternative fuel transitions, have furthered our understanding of possible transition dynamics, but these types of analysis exclude broader systemic issues concerning energy system evolution (e.g. supplies and prices of low-carbon energy) and the politics of transitions. This paper presents a hybrid approach to assessing hydrogen transitions in the UK, by linking qualitative scenarios with quantitative energy systems modelling using the UK MARKAL model. This is the second in a series of reports from UK ERC's Energy 2050 project. Evidence from energy systems analysis suggests that the desirability of hydrogen as a decarbonisation option depends strongly on success in bringing down costs, for both fuel cell technologies and hydrogen production, delivery and storage systems [5, 6, #CITATION_TAG].","The technologies analysed include a number of renewables (marine, bioenergy, wind and solar PV) and also other low carbon options (carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and fuel cells).Technology acceleration is analysed firstly by devising detailed technology-by technology accounts of accelerated development, and then system-level modelling of the potential impacts of this acceleration on the UK energy system from now to 2050.","['It investigates the prospects for accelerated development of a range of low carbon energy supply technologies, and the impact of this acceleration on the decarbonisation of the UK energy system.', 'The report highlights the potentially important role for low carbon supply technology acceleration in the transition to a low carbon energy system in the UK, especially over longer timescales.']"

238,"Typologies are an important way of organizing the complex cause-effect relationships that are key building blocks of the strategy and organization literatures. Types and typologies are ubiquitous, both in every-day social life and in the language of the social sciences. Everybody uses them, but almost no one pays any attention to the nature of their construction.-McKinney (1969: 4) The notion of causality plays a key role in both the strategy and organization literatures. For in-stance, cause-effect relationships are the central way in which strategic decisions and organization-al structures are understood and communicated in organizations (Ford, 1985; Huff, 1990; Huff &amp; Jen-kins, 2001). Building on this insight, the cognitive strategy literature has aimed to map and explain the causal reasoning of managers regarding both organizational performance and competitive envi-ronments (e.g., Barr, Stimpert,  &amp; Huff, 1992; Nad-karni &amp; Narayanan, 2007a, 2007b; Reger &amp; Huff, 1993). Similarly, cause-effect relationships are the main building blocks of the organizational design literature and have recently received increasing at-tention (e.g., Burton &amp; Obel, 2004; Grandori &amp; Fur The present study builds on the existing literature that underscores the value of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) (e.g., #CITATION_TAG; Woodside, 2013; Woodside & Zhang, 2013) and shows that the proposed methodological tool offers much in terms of understanding causal relationships, by virtue of providing information that is unique in comparison with the information that conventional correlational methods provide.","Using data on high-technology firms, I empirically investigate configurations based on the Miles and Snow typology using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA).","['Here, I develop a novel theoretical perspective on causal core and periphery, which is based on how elements of a configuration are connected to outcomes.']"
1200,"The latter stem, in part, from contradictions between potentially incompatible organizational agendas and social logics that drive the use of this approach. The presence of such diverse and partially contradictory aims creates tensions with the result that efforts are at times diverted from the aim of producing sustainable change and improvement. This paper examines the challenges of investigating clinical incidents through the use of Root Cause Analysis. Studies from across the world have shown that clinical mistakes are a major threat to the safety of patient care (World Health Organisation 2004). For the National Health Service (NHS) of England and Wales it is estimated that one in ten hospital patients experience some form of error, and each year these cost the service over PS2billion in remedial care (Department of Health 2000). Unsurprisingly, 'patient safety' is now a major international health policy priority, questioning the efficacy of existing regulatory practices and proposing a new ethos of learning. Within England and Wales, the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) has been created to lead policy development and champion service-wide learning, whilst throughout the NHS the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) has been introduced to enable this learning (NPSA 2003). We are also aware that RCA has been interpreted as an emerging form of self-surveillance (#CITATION_TAG) and potentially extending the principle of concertive control among healthcare practitioners (Iedema, Jorm, Long et al., 2006).",,"['This paper investigates the extent to which, in seeking to better manage the threats to patient safety, this policy agenda represents a transition in medical regulation']"
1202,"The latter stem, in part, from contradictions between potentially incompatible organizational agendas and social logics that drive the use of this approach. The presence of such diverse and partially contradictory aims creates tensions with the result that efforts are at times diverted from the aim of producing sustainable change and improvement. This paper examines the challenges of investigating clinical incidents through the use of Root Cause Analysis. This grounded the mirror system hypothesis of Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998) which offers the mirror system for grasping as a key neural ""missing link"" between the abilities of our nonhuman ancestors of 20 million years ago and modern human language, with manual gestures rather than a system for vocal communication providing the initial seed for this evolutionary process. The present article, however, goes ""beyond the mirror"" to offer hypotheses on evolutionary changes within and outside the mirror systems which may have occurred to equip Homo sapiens with a language-ready brain. Crucial to the early stages of this progression is the mirror system for grasping and its extension to permit imitation. Imitation is seen as evolving via a so-called simple system such as that found in chimpanzees (which allows imitation of complex ""object-oriented"" sequences but only as the result of extensive practice) to a so-called complex system found in humans (which allows rapid imitation even of complex sequences, under appropriate conditions) which supports pantomime. It is argued that these stages involve biological evolution of both brain and body. By contrast, it is argued that the progression from protosign and protospeech to languages with full-blown syntax and compositional semantics was a historical phenomenon in the development of Homo sapiens, involving few if any further biological changes. For example, #CITATION_TAG warn that closure and consensus are often enemies of the capacity of organisations to learn from incidents that require them ""to confront the possibility that the story being told is simultaneously a tale of disorder in which the reality of danger masquerades as safety and a tale of order in which the reality masquerades as danger"" (p. 456).","The starting point is the observation that both premotor area F5 in monkeys and Broca's area in humans contain a ""mirror system"" active for both execution and observation of manual actions, and that F5 and Broca's area are homologous brain regions. This is hypothesized to have provided the substrate for the development of protosign, a combinatorially open repertoire of manual gestures, which then provides the scaffolding for the emergence of protospeech (which thus owes little to nonhuman vocalizations), with protosign and protospeech then developing in an expanding spiral.","['The article analyzes the neural and functional grounding of language skills as well as their emergence in hominid evolution, hypothesizing stages leading from abilities known to exist in monkeys and apes and presumed to exist in our hominid ancestors right through to modern spoken and signed languages.']"
127,"Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk obtained through bioclimatic envelope models calibrated with native species distribution data can play a critical role in invasive species management. Forecasts of invasion risk to novel environments, however, remain controversial. Only when incorporating a measure of human modification of habitats within the native range do bioclimatic envelope models yield credible predictions of invasion risk for parakeets across Europe. Invasion risk derived from models that account for differing niche requirements of phylogeographic lineages and those that do not achieve similar statistical accuracy, but there are pronounced differences in areas predicted to be susceptible for invasion. Aim To mitigate the threat invasive species pose to ecosystem functioning, reliable risk assessment is paramount. In the recent past, availability of large data sets of species presences has increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with developments in geographical information systems and statistical methods, has enabled scientists to calculate, for thousands of species, the environmental conditions of their distributional areas. Climate is generally recognized as a chief driver of species' distributions at large spatial scales (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), although the broad distributional limits governed by climate may be modified by factors such as habitat availability, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations (#CITATION_TAG).",I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.,"['I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment.']"

435,"Home to work travel remains the prime focus of mobility management policies, in which the promotion of carpooling is one of the main strategies. Besides governments, employers are key players in this strive for a more sustainable commute.

Therefore, this paper takes the workplace as research unit to analyse the popularity of carpooling in Belgium.

Although our main focus is on workplaces, a multilevel perspective is used (#CITATION_TAG).","It starts with a history of urban transport and land-use models and observes a trend towards increasing conceptual, spatial and temporal resolution stimulated by improved data availability, higher computer speed and better theories about mobility and location of individual behaviour.","['Abstract This paper discusses the usefulness of the trend towards microsimulation in urban transport and land-use modelling for the planning practice.', 'As a possible solution to the macro-micro debate, it calls for a theory of multi-level models according to which for each planning task there is an appropriate level of conceptual, spatial and temporal resolution.']"
521,"Externalities arise when firms discriminate between on-and off-net calls or when subscription demand is elastic. This literature predicts that profit decreases and consumer surplus increases in termination charge in a neighborhood of termination cost. This creates a puzzle since in reality we see regulators worldwide pushing termination rates down while being opposed by network operators. This creates a price differential between services that are identical for the consumer and generates network externalities despite network interconnection. #CITATION_TAG find that if firms set linear prices but can discriminate between on-and off-net calls, then above cost termination charges induce 3 In the initial stages of wireless telecommunication the most important regulatory issue was the fixedto-mobile (FTM) termination rate, i.e. the price to be paid by the incumbent land-line operator for calls terminating on a mobile network.","Our companion article developed a clear conceptual framework of negotiated or regulated interconnection agreements between rival operators and studied competition between interconnected networks, under the assumption of nondiscriminatory pricing.","[""This article relaxes this assumption and allows networks to charge different prices for calls terminating on the subscriber's network and those terminating on a rivals network.""]"
194,"A hallmark of many an intuitionistic theory is the existence property, EP, i.e., if the theory proves an existential statement then there is a provably definable witness for it. However, there are well known exceptions, for example, the full intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, IZF, does not have the existence property, where IZF is formulated with Collection. However, in this paper it is shown that several well known intuitionistic set theories with Collection have the weak existence property. As a result, the culprit preventing the weak existence property from obtaining must consist of a combination of Collection and unbounded Separation. However, this requires a new form of ordinal analysis for theories with Power Set and Exponentiation (cf. Rathjen (2011) [39]) and is beyond the scope of the current paper. Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory, CZF, has emerged as a standard reference theory that relates to constructive predicative mathematics as ZFC relates to classical Cantorian mathematics. A hallmark of this theory is that it possesses a type-theoretic model. In [#CITATION_TAG, 36, 37] the author of the present paper developed a different machinery for showing the DP and the NEP (and several other properties) directly for extensional set theories.","Aczel showed that it has a formulae-as-types interpretation in Martin-Lof's intuitionist theory of types [14, 15]. It is shown that Kleene realizability provides a self-validating semantics for CZF, viz. this notion of realizability can be formalized in CZF and demonstrably in CZF it can be verified that every theorem of CZF is realized. This semantics, then, is put to use in establishing several equiconsistency results. Specifically, augmenting CZF by well-known principles germane to Russian constructivism and Brouwer's intuitionism turns out to engender theories of equal proof-theoretic strength with the same stock of provably recursive functions","['This paper, though, is concerned with a rather different interpretation.']"

To significantly impact biological research, notably in developing novel therapeutics, it is critical that the model adequately represents the captured system. We propose an approach based on argumentation from safety-critical systems engineering, where a system is subjected to a stringent analysis of compliance against identified criteria. However, many existing safety cases, in their attempt to manage potentially complex arguments, are poorly structured, presented and understood. This creates problems in developing and maintaining safety cases, and in capturing successful safety arguments for use on future projects. Drawing on safety-case argumentation, we create a diagrammatic summary of the structured argument of fitness for purpose, using a visual notation closely based on the standard safety-critical argumentation notation, goal structuring notation (GSN) [#CITATION_TAG, 29].","A safety case should present a clear, comprehensive and defensible argument that a system is acceptably safe to operate within a particular context. This approach is based upon a graphical technique -- the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) -- and has three strands. Firstly, a method for the use of GSN is defined together with an approach to supporting incremental safety case development. Thirdly, the concept of `Safety Case Patterns&apos; is defined as a means of supporting and promoting the reuse of successful safety arguments between safety cases. Examples of the approach are provided throughout.","['This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent approach to the development, presentation, maintenance and reuse of the safety arguments within a safety case.']"

The article briefly summarizes neurocognitive findings that relate to mind-wandering and evidence regarding adverse effects of mind-wandering on task performance as well as evidence suggesting adaptive functions in regard to creative problem-solving, planning, resisting delay discounting, and memory consolidation. When we speak of consciousness we are referring to the sum total of events in awareness. The term by no means exhausts the realm of things psychological, but it does encompass all of an individual's direct experience. When we speak of the flow of consciousness we are referring to the changes that take place in consciousness over time. The events of consciousness are, of course, extremely complex and varied. They do not contain the imagery of current perceptual activity but they contain imaginai qualities that one can describe in terms of forms, colors, sounds, words, smells, tastes, temperatures, and the like. There are dream-like segments in waking states -in one study 25% of waking thought samples were rated by participants as having at least a trace of dream-like qualities Cox, 1987-1988), which agrees approximately with other results (Foulkes and Fleisher, 1975; #CITATION_TAG Klinger, -1979) -as well as there being waking-like cognitive content in dreams.","They embrace images in every sensory modality and in every degree of vividness, realism, and believability, including inner dialogue, hallucinations, reveries, and dreamlike sequences; and they also embrace qualities that are at the same time less figured and more pervasive than these--the affects.","['This chapter focuses on a broad class of these conscious contents.', 'This chapter brings together ideas and data regarding ways to observe thought, the dimensions and forms of thought, and the factors that determine the content of thought as it changes from one moment to the next.']"

565,"Much bioethical scholarship is concerned with the social, legal and philosophical implications of new and emerging science and medicine, as well as with the processes of research that under-gird these innovations. Science and technology studies (STS), and the related and interpenetrating disciplines of anthropology and sociology, have also explored what novel technoscience might imply for society, and how the social is constitutive of scientific knowledge and technological artefacts. More recently, social scientists have interrogated the emergence of ethical issues: they have documented how particular matters come to be regarded as in some way to do with 'ethics', and how this in turn enjoins particular types of social action. In sum, engagements between STS and bioethics are increasingly important in order to understand and manage the complex dynamics between science, medicine and ethics in society. In this paper, I will discuss some of this and other STS (and STS-inflected) literature and reflect on how it might complement more 'traditional' modes of bioethical enquiry. Citizens today are increasingly expected to be knowledgeable about and prepared to engage with biomedical knowledge. This is not based on an assumption that non-scientists are 'ignorant' and are thus unable to 'appropriately' use or debate science; rather, it is underpinned by an empirically-grounded observation that some individuals may be unfamiliar with certain specificities of particular modes of research and ethical frameworks, and, as a consequence, have their autonomy compromised when invited to participate in biomedical investigations. Public bioethics will have to play a key role in such an endeavour, and indeed will contribute in important ways to the opening up of new spaces of symmetrical engagement between bioethicists, scientists and wider publics-and hence to the democratisation of the bioethical enterprise. In so doing, opportunities for more democratic forms of bioethical deliberation are also restricted [#CITATION_TAG].",,"[""In this article, I wish to reframe this 'public understanding of science' project, and place fresh emphasis on public understandings of research: an engagement with the everyday laboratory practices of biomedicine and its associated ethics, rather than with specific scientific facts."", 'Drawing on the perspectives of participants in my own sociological research on the social and ethical dimensions of neuroscience, I argue that public understanding of biomedical research and its ethics should be developed both at the community level and within the research moment itself in order to enhance autonomy and promote more socially robust science.']"

607,"The main problem with the state of the art in the semantic search domain is the lack of comprehensive evaluations. There exist only a few efforts to evaluate semantic search tools and to compare the results with other evaluations of their kind. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for testing and benchmarking semantic search tools that was developed within the SEALS project. The semantic web presents the vision of a distributed, dynamically growing knowledge base founded on formal logic. Common users, however, seem to have problems even with the simplest Boolean expressions. As queries from web search engines show, the great majority of users simply do not use Boolean expressions. Searching the Semantic Web lies at the core of many activities that are envisioned for the Semantic Web; many researchers have investigated means for indexing and searching the Semantic Web [1] [2] [#CITATION_TAG] [4] 6, 9, 13, 14, 16].","We address this problem by presenting a natural language interface to semantic web querying. The interface allows formulating queries in Attempto Controlled English (ACE), a subset of natural English. Each ACE query is translated into a discourse representation structure - a variant of the language of first-order logic - that is then translated into an N3-based semantic web querying language using an ontology-based rewriting framework.",['So how can we help users to query a web of logic that they do not seem to understand?']

Naming ability on the PALPA54 subtest (#CITATION_TAG) indicated residual lexical capacity with scores of 59/60 for spoken (with no penalty for phonemic paraphasias as long as the target was recognizable) and 59/60 for written naming.","Intended both as a clinical instrument and research tool, PALPA is a set of resource materials enabling the user to select language tasks that can be tailored to the investigation of an individual patient's impaired and intact abilities.

850,"Choices are not only communicated via explicit actions but also passively through inaction. Additionally, the choice itself was biased towards action such that subjects tended to choose a photograph obtained by action more often than a photographed obtained through inaction. In this study we investigated how active or passive choice impacts upon the choice process itself as well as a preference change induced by choice. Rationale: Decision-making involves two fundamental axes of control namely valence, spanning reward and punishment, and action, spanning invigoration and inhibition. We recently exploited a go/no-go task whose contingencies explicitly decouple valence and action to show that these axes are inextricably coupled during learning. Given that this bias is independent of valence it may reflect a general action bias observed in instrumental learning under uncertainty [24, [#CITATION_TAG] [31] [32].","Conversely, serotonin is implicated in motor inhibition and punishment processing. Methods: We combined computational modeling with pharmacological manipulation in 90 healthy human volunteers, using levodopa and citalopram to affect dopamine and serotonin, respectively.",['Objective: To investigate the role of dopamine and serotonin in the interaction between action and valence during learning.']
124,"Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk obtained through bioclimatic envelope models calibrated with native species distribution data can play a critical role in invasive species management. Forecasts of invasion risk to novel environments, however, remain controversial. Only when incorporating a measure of human modification of habitats within the native range do bioclimatic envelope models yield credible predictions of invasion risk for parakeets across Europe. Invasion risk derived from models that account for differing niche requirements of phylogeographic lineages and those that do not achieve similar statistical accuracy, but there are pronounced differences in areas predicted to be susceptible for invasion. Aim To mitigate the threat invasive species pose to ecosystem functioning, reliable risk assessment is paramount. The taxonomic rank of subspecies remains highly contentious, largely because traditional subspecies boundaries have sometimes been contradicted by molecular phylogenetic data. However, the global generality of this phenomenon remains unclear due to this previous study's narrow geographic focus on continental Nearctic and Palearctic subspecies. The broader picture is that avian subspecies often provide an effective short-cut for estimating patterns of intraspecific genetic diversity, thereby providing a useful tool for the study of evolutionary divergence and conservation. Subspecies are generally based on discontinuities in the geographical distribution of phenotypic traits instead of molecular phylogenies, but can generally be considered useful proxies of patterns of divergence among populations (#CITATION_TAG).","We suggest that the widespread impression that avian subspecies are not real arises from a predominance of studies focusing on continental subspecies in North America and Eurasia, regions which show unusually low levels of genetic differentiation.","['Here, we present a new global analysis of avian subspecies and show that 36% of avian subspecies are, in fact, phylogenetically distinct.']"
143,"Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to various methods of assessing the beat-to-beat variation in the heart over time, in order to draw inference on the outflow of the autonomic nervous system. Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV. Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. In addition, basal respiratory frequency has a non-linear relationship with spectral power as breathing rate falls below approximately 0.15 Hz (as it occasionally does in athletes; #CITATION_TAG).","Fifteen male athletes were subjected to HRV measurements under six randomised breathing conditions: spontaneous breathing frequency (SBF) and five others at controlled breathing frequencies (CBF) (0.20; 0.175; 0.15; 0.125 and 0.10 Hz). The subjects were divided in two groups: the first group included athletes with SBF <0.15 Hz (infSBF) and the second athletes with SBF higher than 0.15 Hz (supSBF). In this study, BF was the main modulator of the LF/HF ratio in both controlled breathing and spontaneous breathing.

Although differential mortality decline for cardiovascular diseases has been suggested as an important contributory factor, it is not known what its quantitative contribution was, and to what extent other causes of death have contributed to the widening gap in total mortality. In most countries, mortality from cardiovascular diseases declined proportionally faster in the upper socioeconomic groups. In all countries with the exception of Italy (Turin), changes in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed about half of the widening relative gap for total mortality. For these causes, widening inequalities were sometimes due to increasing mortality rates in the lower socioeconomic groups. We found rising rates of mortality from lung cancer, breast cancer, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, and injuries among men and/or women in lower socioeconomic groups in several countries.

1211,"A central component of mind wandering is mental time travel, the calling to mind of remembered past events and of imagined future ones. Mental time travel may also be critical to the evolution of language, which enables us to communicate about the non-present, sharing memories, plans, and ideas. Mental time travel is indexed in humans by hippocampal activity, and studies also suggest that the hippocampus in rats is active when the animals replay or pre play activity in a spatial environment, such as a maze. Mental time travel may have ancient origins, contrary to the view that it is unique to humans. The idea that memory is composed of distinct systems has a long history but became a topic of experimental inquiry only after the middle of the 20th century. Beginning about 1980, evidence from normal subjects, amnesic patients, and experimental animals converged on the view that a fundamental distinction could be drawn between a kind of memory that is accessible to conscious recollection and another kind that is not. Subsequent work shifted thinking beyond dichotomies to a view, grounded in biology, that memory is composed of multiple separate systems supported, for example, by the hippocampus and related structures, the amygdala, the neostriatum, and the cerebellum. Declarative memory, in turn, can be divided into episodic memory, which is personal memory for past episodes, and semantic memory, which is basic knowledge about the world (#CITATION_TAG).",,['This article traces the development of these ideas and provides a current perspective on how these brain systems operate to support behavior.']

297,"After at least a decade of parallel tool development, parallelization of scientific applications remains a significant undertaking. Typically parallelization is a specialized activity supported only partially by the programming tool set, with the programmer involved with parallel issues in addition to sequential ones. The aim of parallel programming tools is to automate the latter without sacrificing performance and portability, allowing the programmer to focus on algorithm specification and development. Computational molecular dynamics is an important application requiring large amounts of computing time. Parallel processing offers very high performance potential, but irregular problems like molecular dynamics have proven difficult to map onto parallel machines.

480,"to a Cartesian view of distinct unobservable minds. Voice, it is suggested, necessarily gives rise to a temporally bound subjectivity, whether it is in inner speech (Descartes' ""cogito""), in conversation, or in the synchronized utterances of collective speech found in prayer, protest, and sports arenas world wide. The notion of a fleeting subjective pole tied to dynamically entwined participants who exert reciprocal influence upon each other in real time provides an insightful way to understand notions of common ground, or socially shared cognition. It suggests that the remarkable capacity to construct a shared world that is so characteristic of Homo sapiens may be grounded in this ability to become dynamically entangled as seen, e.g., in the centrality of joint attention in human interaction. Empirical evidence of dynamic entanglement in joint speaking is found in behavioral and neuroimaging studies. A convergent theoretical vocabulary is now available in the concept of participatory sense-making, leading to the development of a rich scientific agenda liberated from a stifling metaphysics that obscures, rather than illuminates, the means by which we come to inhabit a shared world. Questioning this commitment leads us to recognize that the boundaries conventionally separating the linguistic from the non-linguistic can appear arbitrary, omitting much that is regularly present during vocal communication. The thesis is put forward that uttering, or voicing, is a much older phenomenon than the formal structures studied by the linguist, and that the voice has found elaborations and codifications in other domains too, such as in systems of ritual and rite. Synchronously read speech has shown to reduce a high degree of speaker variability of reading exhibited by speakers in laboratory recording; e.g., pause placement and duration, and speech rate. However, quantitative analysis of speech rate has rarely been found in studies on synchronous speech. Speech produced in these constrained laboratory settings is remarkably unremarkable, and the technique of having subjects speak in synchrony has been used as a device for obtaining unmarked speech in several phonetic studies (Krivokapić, 2007; #CITATION_TAG; O'Dell et al., 2010; Dellwo and Friedrichs, 2012).","Consistency and variability of speech rate are compared in both reading types across repetitions within a subject, across subjects, and across dialects.

361,"Background Unassisted cessationquitting without pharmacological or professional supportis an enduring phenomenon. Unassisted cessation persists even in nations advanced in tobacco control where cessation assistance such as nicotine replacement therapy, the stop-smoking medications bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural assistance are readily available. We review the qualitative literature on the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted. Motivation, although widely reported, had only one clear meaning, that is 'the reason for quitting'. Commitment was equated to seriousness or resoluteness, was perceived as key to successful quitting, and was often used to distinguish earlier failed quit attempts from the final successful quit attempt. Commitment had different dimensions. BACKGROUND Healthcare professionals frequently advise patients to improve their health by stopping smoking. Such advice may be brief, or part of more intensive interventions. In some trials, subjects were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. There was insufficient evidence, from indirect comparisons, to establish a significant difference in the effectiveness of physician advice according to the intensity of the intervention, the amount of follow up provided, and whether or not various aids were used at the time of the consultation in addition to providing advice. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. Yet, although these interventions are efficacious, [6] [7] [#CITATION_TAG] the majority of smokers who quit successfully do so without using them, choosing instead to quit unassisted, that is without pharmacological or professional support.","SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).

494,"Understanding how children develop in this complex environment will require a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of how the child and environment interact-- both within and beyond the laboratory. Categories, like children, do not exist in isolation. Consequently, category learning cannot be easily separated from the learning context--nor should it be. According to a systems perspective of cognition and development, categorization emerges as the product of multiple factors combining in time (Thelen and Smith, 1994). To be as inclusive as possible, we consider any case in which a participant responds to how stimuli may be grouped as evidence of category learning. You may notice in these examples that we have not included children's ages because, according to a systems view, research should not be about age per se. Obviously, age must be taken into account in experimental design because age is generally (but not perfectly) correlated with developmental level (e.g., appropriate motor responses differ for a 2-year-old vs. 2-month-old). WHO IS INVOLVED IN LEARNING In the real world children learn through play and independent exploration (HirshPasek et al., 2009). However, in the lab children are seldom alone. This is important because children adjust their learning depending on who is providing information (e.g., the same or different experimenter, Goldenberg and Sandhofer, 2013; human or robot, O'Connell et al., 2009; mom or dad, Pancsofar and VernonFeagans, 2006). Children are also opportunistic and will look for any signal of what the right answer is. For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., Akhtar et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984). Moreover, who the child is also matters. WHAT IS BEING CATEGORIZED All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (Sloutsky, 2010). Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004; Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007). In naturalistic environments, categories are often ad hoc and flexible (Barsalou, 1983). For example, the category ""toys to pick up before bed"" may be discussed every day, but each day it may include different items. Furthermore, the process of categorizing objects is not independent of the objects themselves: different objects may be more or less flexibly assigned to www.frontiersin.org January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 1 different categories depending on the context (Mareschal and Tan, 2007) and information available (Horst et al., 2009). Where a child lives impacts what social categories they learn and the category choices they make. For example, Black Xhosa children in South Africa prefer own-race faces if they live in a primarily Black township, but prefer higher-status race faces if they live in a racially diverse city (Shutts et al., 2011). In the lab, location matters both in terms of where the child is and where the stimuli are. For example, children are more likely to learn names for non-solid substances if introduced to the gooey items in a familiar highchair context (Perry et al., 2014). For example, yes/no questions lead to a stronger shape bias than forced-choice questions (Samuelson et al., 2009), various types of feedback differentially affect learning categories with highly salient features vs. less salient features (Hammer et al., 2012) and highly variable category members facilitate category name generalization (Perry et al., 2010) whereas less variable category members facilitate category name retention (Twomey et al., 2014). Categorization does not reflect static knowledge; rather, category learning unfolds over time and is a product of nested timescales. Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (McMurray et al., 2012). That is, learning continues even on test trials--in fact, participants may not realize the shift from learning to test trials. Consequently, different behaviors are observed depending on when during the categorization process category learning is assessed (Horst et al., 2005). Category learning is a product of nested timescales including (a) the current moment (e.g., how similar the stimuli are on the current trial, Horst and Twomey, 2013), (b) the ""just previous"" past (e.g., what happens during the intertrial interval, Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007; whether stimuli on the first test trial are novel or familiar, Schoner and Thelen, 2006; and trial order effects Wilkinson et al., 2003; Vlach et al., 2008) and (c) developmental history (e.g., vocabulary level, Ellis and Oakes, 2006; Horst et al., 2009; Perry and Samuelson, 2011). Because children's behavior is never solely the product of a single timescale it is impossible to create an experiment that taps only into category learning in the moment or only knowledge children brought to the lab. For example, Kovack-Lesh et al. UNEXPECTED INFLUENCES If researchers view categorization as static knowledge, then neither the when or how should matter. Many researchers hold this view, which purports experiments are designed to test what a child knows upon arrival at the lab: trial order and trial types are largely trivial. Small variations in what children experience during category learning can have dramatic impact on how they form categories (e.g., sequential vs. simultaneous presentation, Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Lawson, 2014) and differences in testing contexts can lead to indications of what has been learned (Cohen and Marks, 2002). Subtle experimental design decisions, such as the number of test trials to include, may not seem theoretically significant, but they can have profound effects on children's behavior. As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (Axelsson and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Samuelson et al., 2007). For example, how broadly participants generalize a category label depends on where the exemplars are presented and if the exemplars are visible simultaneously (Spencer et al., 2011). In particular whether more or less diverse examples occur in the first block of trials influences later generalization (see Spencer et al., 2011, Supplementary Materials). Unexpected influences may not be of immediate theoretical interest to a given experimenter, but they are still often informative--even at times vital-- to the underlying processes at work (e.g., the influence of novelty on children's selection is informative for understanding how prior memory influences current learning). We recognize this can be impractical with populations that are costly to recruit, in which case such factors may Frontiers in Psychology | Cognition January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 2 be controlled for statistically, for example with item-level analyses. OUTLOOK Category learning unfolds across both space and time, and small differences at one moment (e.g., shared features among the stimuli; whether exemplars are identical) can create a ripple of effects on real behavior. Behavior emerges from the combination of many factors, including those not explicitly manipulated or controlled by the experimenter. However, just as it is important to acknowledge these unexpected influences, we must not fail to see the forest for the trees. If a behavior such as category learning can only be captured in an ideal environment under carefully-controlled conditions, how much can we generalize to the contexts in which learning typically occurs? Theoretical accounts that neglect the rich influence of context in real time are too narrow to be applied outside the lab (Simmering and Perone, 2013). What we as researchers are ultimately trying to understand is how learning occurs in a real, cluttered world across time and a variety of contexts. Consequently, a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of cognitive development will require understanding how the child (or adult) and environment interact. In this paper, we include many different types of behaviors under the umbrella term ""categorization."" Our goal is not to create a catalog of milestones; our goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms driving change. Our point, however, is that we will learn more about category learning if we stop asking questions such as ""how do prototype representations compare between 6 and 8 months of age?"" Thus, in order to understand the process of categorization, researchers must ensure that the results they find in the lab are not too closely tied to the specific stimuli. Thus, it is vital to acknowledge the impact of such unexpected influences if we want to understand how categorization unfolds over time. People are remarkably smart: they use language, possess complex motor skills, make non-trivial inferences, develop and use scientific theories, make laws, and adapt to complex dynamic environments. It is argued that conceptual development progresses from simple perceptual grouping to highly abstract scientific concepts. This paper reviews a large body of empirical evidence supporting this proposal. All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (#CITATION_TAG).","This proposal of conceptual development has four parts. First, it is argued that categories in the world have different structure. Third, these systems exhibit differential maturational course, which affects how categories of different structures are learned in the course of development.",['Much of this knowledge requires concepts and this paper focuses on how people acquire concepts.']

This paper investigates the hydrodynamic performances of an SPH code incorporating an artificial heat conductivity term in which the adopted signal velocity is applicable when gravity is present. This article explores the relationship between the making of things and the making of people at the Bronze Age tell at Szazhalombatta, Hungary. Potters literally came into being as potters through repeated bodily enactment of potting skills. The creation of potters as a social category was essential to the ongoing creation of specific forms of material culture. This has motivated the development of adaptative mesh refinement (AMR) methods, in which the spatial resolution of the grid is locally refined according to some selection criterion (Berger & Colella 1989; Kravtsov, Klypin & Khokhlov 1997; #CITATION_TAG).",Potters also gained their identity in the social sphere through the connection between their potting performance and their audience. We trace degrees of skill in the ceramic record to reveal the material articulation of non-discursive knowledge and consider the ramifications of the differential acquisition of non-discursive knowledge for the expression of different kinds of potter's identities. We examine the implications of altered potters' performances and the role of non-discursive knowledge in the construction of social models of the Bronze Age.,"['Focusing on potters and potting, we explore how the performance of non-discursive knowledge was critical to the construction of social categories.']"
76,"Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space. Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. Forest structure and dynamics vary across the Amazon Basin in an east-west gradient coincident with variations in soil fertility and geology. Basin-wide differences in stand-level turnover rates are mostly influenced by soil physical properties with variations in rates of coarse wood production mostly related to soil phosphorus status. A hypothesis of self-maintaining forest dynamic feedback mechanisms initiated by edaphic conditions is proposed. However, allometric equations that relate physical attributes of trees to their above-ground biomass normally rely on three parameters: in addition to tree height (H), tree diameter at 1.3 m (D) and wood density (ρ) are very important (Chave et al., 2005), and mean values and ratios between these parameters vary significantly between regions (Chave et al., 2005; Feldpausch et al., 2012; #CITATION_TAG), associated with different species communities (ter Steege et al., 2006).","Soil samples were collected in a total of 59 different forest plots across the Amazon Basin and analysed for exchangeable cations, carbon, nitrogen and pH, with several phosphorus fractions of likely different plant availability also quantified. Physical properties were additionally examined and an index of soil physical quality developed. Bivariate relationships of soil and climatic properties with above-ground wood productivity, stand-level tree turnover rates, above-ground wood biomass and wood density were first examined with multivariate regression models then applied. Taking this into account, otherwise enigmatic variations in stand-level biomass across the Basin were then accounted for through the interacting effects of soil physical and chemical properties with climate.","['This has resulted in the hypothesis that soil fertility may play an important role in explaining Basin-wide variations in forest biomass, growth and stem turnover rates.']"
1029,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. The European Association for Palliative Care Task (EAPC) Force on the Development of Palliative Care in Europe was created in 2003 and the results of its work are now being reported in full, both here and in several other publications. Different models of service delivery have been developed and implemented throughout the countries of Europe. For example, in addition to the UK, the countries of Germany, Austria, Poland and Italy have a well-developed and extensive network of hospices. The model for mobile teams or hospital support teams has been adopted in a number of countries, most notably in France. Day Centres are a development that is characteristic of the UK with hundreds of these services currently in operation. The number of beds per million inhabitants ranges between 45-75 beds in the most advanced European countries, to only a few beds in others. The countries with the highest development of palliative care in their respective subregions as measured in terms of ratio of services per one million inhabitants are: Western Europe - UK (15); Central and Eastern Europe - Poland (9); Commonwealth of Independent States - Armenia (8). MA: Why have the development of palliative care and the drive for legal euthanasia been synergistic only in Belgium? How did Belgian ""exceptionalism"" come to be? That Belgium is one of the countries with the most developed palliative care systems (Centeno et al. 2007; #CITATION_TAG;) and the third country to have legally regulated euthanasia 5 is not paradoxical, as we have tried to make clear above, but it may also not be accidental.","Four studies, each with different working methods, made up the study protocol: a literature review, a review of all the existing palliative care directories in Europe, a qualitative ;Eurobarometer' survey and a quantitative ;Facts Questionnaire' survey.","['The objective of the Task Force is to assess the degree of palliative care development in the European Region as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).', 'The Task Force is a collaboration between EAPC, the International Observatory on End of Life Care, Help the Hospices and the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care.', 'The work of the Task Force covers the entire WHO European Region of 52 countries.', 'In this article we present a comparative study on the development of palliative care in Europe, drawing on all four elements of the study.']"

They owe their brightness to the dense confined plasma, and this review focuses on loops mostly as structures confining plasma. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered and, therefore, topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones, which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with separate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. Some of the most successful pathogens of human, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), HIV, and Leishmania donovani not only establish chronic infections but also remain a grave global threat. These pathogens have developed innovative strategies to evade immune responses such as antigenic shift and drift, interference with antigen processing/presentation, subversion of phagocytosis, induction of immune regulatory pathways, and manipulation of the costimulatory molecules. Costimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of various cells play a decisive role in the initiation and sustenance of immunity. Exploitation of the ""code of conduct"" of costimulation pathways provides evolutionary incentive to the pathogens and thereby abates the functioning of the immune system. Impairment by pathogens in the signaling events delivered by costimulatory molecules may be responsible for defective T-cell responses; consequently organisms grow unhindered in the host cells.

Promoting mental health at an individual, community and policy level is central to reducing the incidence of mental health problems, including self-harm and suicide.

An experiment on the formulation of sentences examined the relationship betweeen conceptual acces-sibility and grammatical relations for three levels in the hierarchy, the subject, direct object, and indirect object. There was a strong and systematic influence of conceptual accessibility on the surface syntactic structure of sentences. Converting thoughts into language requires that elements of the nonlinguistic conceptual system be mapped onto syntactic roles in sentences. The nature of the cognitive and communicative features encoded in th Lexico-semantic representations are assigned to particular roles (e.g. the agent of an action) according to a conceptual message; thus this assignment cannot be independent of conceptual-semantic content (#CITATION_TAG; Bock & Warren, 1985).",An experiment provides evidence that con-ceptual accessibility is linked to a hierarchy of grammatical relations that influences sentence formulation.,"['The hypothesis explored in this paper is that this hierarchy is related to the conceptual accessi-bility of the intended referents of noun phrases that commonly occur in particu-lar relational roles, with relations higher in the hierarchy typically occupied by noun phrases representing more accessible concepts.', 'In this paper we examine one aspect of this mapping process, arguing that an important factor in the assignment of conceptual elements to syntactic roles in the pro-duction of sentences is the ease of representing potential referents in thought, or their conceptual accessibility.']"

Drawing on qualitative data from four focus groups, interviews, four accompanied visits to ISE institutions, and field notes, this paper presents an analysis of exclusion from science learning opportunities during visits alongside participants' attitudes, expectations, and conclusions about participation in ISE. During the latter part of the Porfirio Diaz administration (1876-1910), the middle class grew as the city became a commercial and administrative center. Sociologists both criticized and praised the middle class and its role in the country's future. Members of the middle class distinguished themselves from the Porfirian elite and lower classes through bodily behaviors learned from urban conduct manuals and short stories. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) was a devastating blow to the middle class, which rallied around issues of housing, employment, and transportation. In the neighborhood of Santa Maria la Ribera, residents petitioned for urban services and infrastructure improvements. Continuing a long history of civic engagement, the city's middle class publicly organized in response to the anti-clerical policies of the Plutarco Calles administration (1924-1928). Economic and political difficulties hindered the efforts of post-revolutionary municipal and federal leaders to win state loyalty from Mexico City's public employees. At the same time, new mass media, fashions, and popular culture of the 1920s and 1930s challenged existing class distinctions and gender norms. Educational opportunities opened up wider prospects for the middle class, or those seeking middle-class status. Technical schools and the National Polytechnic School offered one set of possibilities. The Lazaro Cardenas administration (1936-1940) aimed to unite the middle class and the working class. As the state bureaucracy grew in the 1930s, Cardenas brought public employees into a close relationship with the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), which later became the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM). By the end of the Cardenas era, many sectors of the middle class felt politically marginalized. In contrast, middle-class public employees became beneficiaries of the country's new corporate state Here Thomas draws on his sense of the differences between ""high"" and ""low"" cultural practices, tastes, and class in terms of the forms of knowledge and behaviors that he believes would be more or less valued within an ISE institution (#CITATION_TAG; Bourdieu, 1984).",,"[""This dissertation looks at Mexico City's middle class from 1890 to 1940.""]"

However, a chasm remains between correlations and causality that stems, in part, from a limiting theoretical framework derived fromMendelian genetics and an incomplete understanding of disease physiology. It does not take much perspicacity to see that what really makes this difference is not the tall hat and the umbrella, but the wealth and nourishment of which they are evidence, and that a gold watch or membership of a club in Pall Mall might be proved in the same way to have the like sovereign virtues.. George Bernard Shaw, The Doctor's Dilemma (Preface), 1909 Distinguishing correlation from causality is the essence of experimental science. Nowhere is the need for this distinction greater today than in complex disease genetics, where proof that specific genes have causal effects on human disease phenotypes remains an enormous burden and challenge. This is particularly so in this age of routine -omic surveys, which can produce more false-positive than true-positive findings (Kohane et al., 2006). Moreover, genomic mapping and sequencing approaches that are invaluable for producing a list of unbiased candidates are, by themselves, insufficient for implicating specific gene(s) in a disease or biological process. We admit at the outset that the answers are not straightforward, and that there are serious technical and intellectual impediments to demonstrating causality for the common complex disorders of man where multiple interacting genes are involved. Nevertheless, the casual conflation of ''mapped locus'' to ''proven gene'' is a constant source of confusion and obfuscation in biology and medicine that requires remedy. Consider that two types of genomic surveys, one horizontal and the other vertical, are now routine for attempting to understand human biology and disease. In contrast, in vertical or deep surveys, we examine the effects of the genome as the DNA information gets processed, and its encoded functions get executed through its transcriptome, proteome, and effectors such as the metabolome. In turn, this implies that proving a gene's specific role in a biological process, either in wild-type or mutant form, may not be straightforward because its role may only be evident when examined in relation to its eptember 26, 2013 a2013 Elsevier Inc. 21 Box 1. biochemical partners, and in particular contexts of diet, pathogen exposure, etc. This is a particular problem in genetic studies of any outbred nonexperimental organism, such as the human, and studies of human disease, where investigations are observational not experimental. It is the strong belief of contemporary human geneticists that uncovering the genetic underpinnings of any disease, however complex, is the surest unbiased route to understanding its pathophysiology and, thus, enabling its future rational therapies (Brooke et al., 2008). Consequently, for this view to prevail, we should require experimental evidence, be it in cells, tissues, experimental models, or the rare patient, for the role of a specific gene in a disease process. We know that even in a simple model organism, budding yeast, synthetic lethality-- where death or some other phenotype occurs only through the conspiracy of mutations at two different genes--is widely prevalent (Costanzo et al., 2010). Interactions of greater complexity and involving more than two genes are also known in yeast (Hartman et al., 2001) and must be true for humans as well. A human genome will typically harbor 20 genes that are fully inactivated, without 22 Cell 155, September 26, 2013 a2013 Else any overt disease phenotype, presumably due to the buffering by other genes (MacArthur et al., 2012). Acknowledging this complexity, there are two general ways forward. The question then is how ''complex'' are complex traits and diseases? The New Genetics: Understanding the Function of Variation With the rediscovery of Mendel's rules of transmission more than 100 years ago, there was a vicious debate on the relative importance of single-gene versus multifactorial inheritance (Provine, 1971). Geneticists quickly, and successfully, focused on deciphering the specific mechanisms of gene inheritance and understanding the physiology of the gene in lieu of answering why some phenotypes had complex etiology and transmission. Nevertheless, the rare examples of deciphering the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, such as for truncate (wing) in Drosophila (Altenburg and Muller, 1920), clearly emphasized that traits were more than the additive properties of multiple genes. Today, it is quite clear that Mendelian inheritance of traits, including diseases, is the exception not the rule. Nevertheless, the entire language of genetics is in terms of individual genes for individual phenotypes, with one function, rather than the ensemble and emergent properties of genomes. This absence of a specific genetics language for the proper description of the multigenic architecture of traits (the ensemble) remains as an impediment to our understanding of the nature and degree of genetic complexity of the phenotype. The case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating, progressive motor neuron disease, illustrates this point (Ludolph et al., 2012). Despite the lack of evidence, we largely describe ALS as being ''heterogeneous'' and comprised of single-gene mutations that can individually lead to disease. In 1993, mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were identified in an autosomal-dominant form of the disease; subsequently, the disorder has become synonymous with aberrant clearance of free radicals as its central pathology. What is often not appreciated, however, is that fewer than 10% of all cases of ALS are familial and even fewer follow an apparent Mendelian pattern. Even within this subset of cases, more than 20 distinct genes, spanning other pathways including RNA homeostasis, have been identified, and SOD1 represents a minority of cases. The molecular etiology for the majority of the sporadic forms of the disease remains unclear, and the scientific problem in understanding ALS is more than simply identification of additional genes. Are these the key rate-limiting steps to ALS or simply one of several required in concert? Is the aberrant clearance of free radicals the fundamental defect or one of many such pathologies or a common downstream consequence? Given the diversity and number of deleterious, even loss-of-function, genetic variants in all of our genomes (Abecasis et al., 2012; MacArthur et al., 2012) and, in the absence of stronger evidence bearing on these questions, it is fair to assume that ALS patients harbor multiple mutations with a plurality of molecular defects and that free radical metabolism is only one of a set of canonical pathophysiologies that define the disease. No doubt, this plurality is the case for cancer (Vogelstein et al., 2013), Crohn's disease (Jostins et al., 2012), and even rare developmental disorders such as Hirschsprung disease (McCallion et al., 2003). Molecular biology, genetics' twin, on the other hand, appears to have been far more successful in deciphering and describing not only its individual components (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein) but also their mutual relationships (e.g., DNAprotein interaction) and ensembles (e.g., transcriptional complex), although this is also far from complete (Watson et al., 2007). The consequences of the primary and interaction effects are often well understood, even though not completely described, at both the molecular and cellular levels (Alberts et al., 2007). Although the use of genetic tools and genetic perspectives are fundamental to this progress, these advances have not as yet led to a major revision of our understanding of trait or disease variation. The major reason for this discrepancy is that, with few exceptions (Raj et al., 2010), molecular and cell biology has focused on the impact of deleting or overexpressing genes and not grappled with the consequences of allelic variation. Classical Mendelian genetics has been a boon to uncovering biology from yeast to humans whenever a mutation with a simple inheritance pattern can be isolated. This approach has been revolutionary in the unicellular yeast, particularly because genetics (and gene manipulation), biochemistry, and cell biology were melded to understand function at a variety of levels. This kind of multilevel approach has been less straightforward, but still largely successful, for a metazoan such asDrosophilawheremore genes andmultiple specialized cells often rescue the effects of a mutation or enhance its minor effect. Success in this endeavor will require a synthesis of many biological disciplines that includes the role of genetic variation as intrinsic to the biological process, not an aspect to be ignored. Consequently, melding variation-based genetic and molecular biological thinking is of critical importance for both fields and is central to our understanding of mechanisms of trait variation, including interindividual variation in disease risk. If most disease, in most humans, is the consequence of the effects of variation at many genes, then knowledge of their functional relationships, rather than merely their identities, is central to understanding the phenotype. This is clearly a problem of ''Systems Biology'' but one that incorporates genetic variation directly. The ability to integrate the realities of such widespread genetic variation, which are ultimately at the causal root of disease mechanisms, with systems biology approaches to understand functional contingencies is central to the challenge of deciphering complex human disease. Genetic Dissection of Complex Phenotypes Genetic transmission rules imply that, even in an intractable species such as us, one can map genomic segments that must contain a disease or trait gene. Such mapping requires identification of the segregation of common sites of variation across the genome, now easy to identify through sequencing, and recognition of a genomic segment identical-by-descent in affected individuals, both within and between families. This task has become easier and more powerful as sequencing technology has improved to provide a nearly complete catalog of variants above 1% frequency in the population; further improvements to sample rarer variants are ongoing (Abecasis et al., 2012). Consequently, genetic mapping, once the province of rare Mendelian disorders, Cell 155, S is now applicable to any human trait or disease. For most complex traits examined, many such loci have been mapped, but the vast majority of the specific genes remain unidentified. We can sometimes guess at a candidate gene within the locus (Jostins et al., 2012), sometimes implicate a gene by virtue of an abundance of rare variants among affected individuals (Jostins et al., 2012), in rare circumstances, use therapeutic modulation of a pathway to pinpoint the gene (Moon et al., 2004), and sometimes identify one by painstaking experimental dissection (Musunuru et al., 2010), but, generally, identification of the underlying gene has not become easier. In fact, most of the mapped loci underlying complex traits remain unresolved at the gene or mechanistic level. Despite the beginning clues to human disease pathophysiology that complex disease mapping is providing, and the slow identification of individual genes, it appears highly unlikely that we can understand traits and diseases this way. There is indeed evidence for scenarios in which variation in complex traits, including risk of complex disease, is mediated by a myriad of variants of minute effect, spread evenly across the genome (Yang et al., 2011). For Mendelian disorders, gene identification within a locus is made possible by each mutation being necessary and sufficient for the phenotype, being functionally deleterious and rare, and having an inheritance pattern consistent with the phenotype. It's the mutation that eventually reveals the biology and explains the phenotype. Any component locus for a complex disease has no such restriction, as the causal variants are neither necessary nor sufficient, nor coding (in fact, they are frequently noncoding and regulatory) nor rare (Emison et al., 2010; Jostins et al., 2012). Currently, the major attempts to overcome this impediment involve reliance on single severe mutations at the very same component genes and eptember 26, 2013 a2013 Elsevier Inc. 23 Genetic association studies in humans can synergize with prior knowledge and systems-level quantitative analysis to generate predictions of what pathways and modules are disrupted, where (anatomically), and when (developmentally) to yield a specificmorphological or biochemical phenotype. Consequently, these strategies themselves depend on the hidden biology we seek and are applicable only to the most common human diseases. It appears to us that ignorance of biology has become rate limiting for understanding disease pathophysiology, except perhaps for the Mendelian disorders. There are two ways to get out of this vicious cycle (Figure 1). Although we suspect that the numbers of pathways involved are fewer than the numbers of genes involved, this is merely suspicion. Although the genome is linear, its expression and biology are highly nonlinear and hierarchical, being sequestered in specific cells and organelles (Ilsley et al., 2013). Understanding this hierarchy, the province of systems biology, is critical to the solution of the vier Inc. complex inheritance problem (Yosef et al., 2013). One might counter that existing gene ontologies do precisely that, but, even in yeast, this appears to be highly incomplete (Dutkowski et al., 2013). Proving Causality: Molecular Koch's Postulates The evidence that a specific gene is involved in a particular human disease has historically been nonstatistical and based on our experience with identifying mutations in Mendelian diseases. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, all of these rules break down in complex phenotypes where neither cosegregation nor exclusivity to affecteds nor obviously deleterious alleles are likely; moreover, many mutations are suspected to be noncoding and in a diversity of regulatory RNA molecules. Consequently, statistical evidence of enrichment has been the mainstay, but this has two negative consequences: first, scanning across the genome or multiple loci covering tens to hundreds of megabases requires very large sample sizes and very strict levels of significance to guard against themany expected falsepositive findings; second, genetic effects that are small or genes with only a few causal alleles are notoriously difficult to detect, although they may be very important to understanding pathogenesis. This difficulty translates into a low power of detection, as common disease alleles cannot be distinguished from bystander associated alleles, whereas rare alleles are observed too infrequently to provide statistical significance. Consequently, although many genes are ''named'' as being responsible in a complex disease or disease process, proof of their involvement is either absent or circumstantial and not direct. In the late 19th century when bacteria were first shown to cause human disease, they were indiscriminately implicated in all manner of disease with little proof (Brown and Goldstein, 1992). One particularly embarrassing example was alcaptonuria, which Sir Archibald Garrod subsequently showed was inherited and which was his first ''inborn error of metabolism.'' We are likely to repeat this ''witch-hunt'' unless we are careful to note that mapping a locus is not equivalent to identifying the gene, and that identifying a gene and its mutations at a locus depends on numerous untested assumptions (mutational type, mutational frequency in cases and controls, coding or regulatory, cell autonomy). Inmicrobiology, Robert Koch set out three postulates that had to be satisfied to connect a specific bacterium (among the multitudes encountered, not unlike current genome analysis) to a disease: the agent had to be isolated from an affected subject, the agent had to produce disease when transmitted to an animal, and the agent had to be recoverable from an animal's lesion (Falkow, 1988). Simply because we cannot follow Koch to the letter in human patients does not absolve us from the responsibility of demonstrating a rigorous level of proof. This is particularly true if we are to pursue therapeutic targets for these diseases. It is clear that the majority of complex diseases do not harbor this level of proof today; neither do most monogenic disorders. Animal models are attractive because of the ability to do experimental manipulations that test predictions of gene function, but these experiments test the function of a gene in a context that is decidedly different from that with a human patient. However imperfect animal models are, progress in the direction of understanding causality has been very beneficial when gene disruptions alone, perhaps at more than one gene, have taught us fundamental lessons in pathophysiology (Farago et al., 2012). In many cases, investigators have also demonstrated that disease results only when combined with a potent environmental insult. When known, such as the effect of dietary cholesterol vis-a-vis genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in atherosclerosis, such environmental exposures to gene-deficient mouse models have provided a tight circle of proof (Plump et al., 1992). A recent example of gestational hypoxia modulating the effect of Notch signaling and leading to scoliosis in mice and in human families Cell 155, S shows how environmental factors beyond diet can be examined even for congenital disorders (Sparrow et al., 2012). Despite these successes, pursuit of Koch's postulates faces other challenges. For example, mutations in the same gene might not reveal an identical phenotype in humans and in an animal model even if molecular pathways are conserved. This is a particular problem for behavioral phenotypes where brain circuitry may have evolved quite differently in humans and other mammals, challenging our ability to model behavior accurately. Nevertheless, such an analysis might reveal an underlying neural phenotype or a molecular or cellular correlate that is in common and subject to testing of the postulates. Ultimately, a lack of understanding of fundamental physiology is the biggest impediment to our understanding of genetically complex human disease. A unique aspect of genetics research seldom appreciated is that genetic effects are chronic biological exposures and as such can pinpoint the earliest stages of disease not readily studied otherwise. In reality, we still do not fully understand the pathogenesis stemming from some of the earliest identified human disease genes. With better understanding of disease mechanism, it seems likely that many disorders that we think of as ''genetic'' may have ameliorative diet, exercise, or other benign environmental ''treatments.'' Given the potential scientific and medical payoffs of disease gene discovery (Chakravarti, 2001), we argue in this Essay of the need for a rigorous examination of the assumptions under which we connect genes to phenotypes. Below we discuss the nature of the ''proof'' that we desire in order to make fundamental discoveries in human pathophysiology. Success in this difficult task requires us to solve a logical conundrum: how can we understand the genes underlying a phenotype if some of these component factors, in isolation, do not have recognizable phenotypes on their own? Both of these goals are approachable, particularly with recent advances in genome-editing technologies that allow the creation of multiple mutations within a single experimental organism (Wang et al., 2013). The second approach is to focus research on why the disease is complex in the first place. This last aspect is critical: as we argue below, with our current state of knowledge, we are likely to have our greatest success with understanding how genes map onto pathways, and how pathways map onto disease, before a true quantitative understanding of disease biology emerges. The chief criteria have been to demonstrate cosegregation with the phenotype in families, exclusivity of the mutation to affected individuals (rare alleles absent in controls), and the nature of themutation (a plausibly deleterious allele at a conserved site within a protein). We need to move beyond lists of plausible genes, to provide rigorous proof for their role in disease. But this goal is unlikely to be achieved in the absence of a superior understanding of the biology of hierarchical function within genomes, how variation alters these functions, and how these altered functions lead to human disease. Probabilistic models of cognition characterize the abstract computational problems underlying inductive inferences and identify their ideal solutions. Recent research employing this strategy has focused on the possibility that the Monte Carlo principle--which concerns sampling from probability distributions in order to perform computations--provides a way to link probabilistic models of cognition to more concrete cognitive and neural processes. We can sometimes guess at a candidate gene within the locus (Jostins et al., 2012), sometimes implicate a gene by virtue of an abundance of rare variants among affected individuals (Jostins et al., 2012), in rare circumstances, use therapeutic modulation of a pathway to pinpoint the gene (#CITATION_TAG), and sometimes identify one by painstaking experimental dissection (Musunuru et al., 2010), but, generally, identification of the underlying gene has not become easier.","To evaluate the theoretical implications of probabilistic models and increase their predictive power, we must understand the relationships between theories at these different levels of analysis.","['This approach differs from traditional methods of investigating human cognition, which focus on identifying the cognitive or neural processes that underlie behavior and therefore concern alternative levels of analysis.', 'One strategy for bridging levels of analysis is to explore cognitive processes that have a direct link to probabilistic inference.']"

56,"The evolutionary history of Mexican ichthyofauna has been strongly linked to natural events, and the impact of pre-Hispanic cultures is little known. The live-bearing fish species Allotoca diazi, Allotoca meeki and Allotoca catarinae occur in areas of biological, cultural and economic importance in central Mexico: Patzcuaro basin, Zirahuen basin, and the Cupatitzio River, respectively. The species are closely related genetically and morphologically, and hypotheses have attempted to explain their systematics and biogeography. The separation of A. diazi and A. meeki was dated to 400-7000 years ago, explained by geological and climate events. The isolation of A. catarinae occurred~1900 years ago. No geological events are documented in the area during this period, but the date is contemporary with P'urhepecha culture settlements. In this paleoenvironment, the presence of the terrestrial mammals was favored by the availability of relatively abundant mesophytic vegetation, which was seemingly perturbed by the volcanic exhalations associated to the monogenetic volcanism of the Michoacan-Guanajuato volcanic field. The isolation of the Allotoca diazi complex from its common ancestor A. zacapuensis, does not contradict the hypothesis of Álvarez (1972) [21] with respect to the connection between the Zacapu and Pátzcuaro basins during the Pleistocene, resulted from the formation of the El Zirate mountain and the northern Pátzcuaro Lake shoreline during the Late Pleistocene [#CITATION_TAG].","This column contains vegetation remnants and bone fragments, including a well preserved jaw of a gomphothere, which was recovered from a volcanic lahar deposit intercalated with fluvial deposits and a pyroclastic succession associated to the basaltic monogenetic volcanism of the Cerro Catio.

This late Pleistocene age can be assigned to the gomphothere as well as to the basaltic volcanic event of the Cerro Catio.

Therefore, this paper takes the workplace as research unit to analyse the popularity of carpooling in Belgium. It is found that carpooling is sensitive to tra%0c congestion reduction only when a congestion externality-based tolling scheme is implemented.

586,"Dinitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria is of particular importance for the nutrient economy of cold biomes, constituting the main pathway for new N supplies to tundra ecosystems. It is prevalent in cyanobacterial colonies on bryophytes and in obligate associations within cyanolichens. Recent studies, ap-plying interspecific variation in plant functional traits to upscale species effects on ecosystems, have all but neglected cryptogams and their association with cyanobacteria. Cyanolichens and bryophytes differed significantly in their cyanobacterial N fixation capacity, which was not driven by microhabitat characteristics, but rather by morphology and physiology. Cyanolichens were much more prominent fixers than bryophytes per unit dry weight, but not per unit area due to their low specific thallus weight. Evidence that lichenized blue-green algae are among the principal agents of N2 fixation on drier terrain in the Arctic and Subarctic has prompted attempts to quantify N-input by lichens in these habitats. The nitrogenase activity in Stereocaulon paschale mats in spruce-lichen woodland of central subarctic Canada has been examined in relation to thallus water content, temperature and incident radiation. It is suggested that simple predictive models are not yet able to accurately describe levels of nitrogenase activity in nature and that estimates of N-input on an annual or seasonal basis may be precarious. Leaching of metabolites from, and decomposition of the thallus are the two principal potential pathways for nitrogen, subsequent to fixation by cyanophilic lichens. Quantitative information on the operation of these pathways in nature is required. Lichenized blue-green algae are probably among the principal agents of nitrogen (N2) fixation in drier terrestrial habitats of the Arctic and Subarctic (Schell & Alexander, 1973; Kallio & Kallio, 1975; Crittenden, 1975; Huss-Danell, 1977). Several investigators working in boreal-arctic systems have used measurements of nitrogenase activity in lichens obtained either under field conditions or in the laboratory to derive estimates of N-input per unit area by the lichen biomass in situ on a seasonal or annual basis. The major shortcoming of such estimates is that their accuracy is unknown: the results of in situ measurements of nitrogenase activity over long periods have not been compared with those of predictive procedures applied to the same period. We have recently been examining the N2 fixing capabilities of S. paschale mats in spruce-lichen woodland in the Abitau-Dunvegan Lakes region of the Northwest Territories (60?21'N, 106'54'W). NITROGEN FIXATION BY STEREOCAULON PASCHALE IN SPRUCE-LICHEN WOODLAND--A CASE STUDY The importance of Stereocaulon paschale as a major component of spruce-lichen woodland in central subarctic Canada has been reviewed by Kershaw (1977). The maintenance of large areas of open Stereocaulon-spruce woodland in this region is dependent upon the high frequency of forest fire, the latter being a natural facet of the environment in the boreal forest (see, e.g. In the AbitauDunvegan Lakes region the periodicity of fire is such that spruce woodland older than 200 y is infrequently encountered on drier terrain and the average reburn interval is less than 100 y (Maikawa & Kershaw, 1976). Stereocaulon paschale usually dominates the lichen synusia in spruce-lichen woodland of between 60 and 130 y old where almost pure carpets of this lichen may occur (Fig. The acetylene (C2H2-) reduction technique (Stewart, Fitzgerald & Burris, 1967) with modifications after Stewart et al. Intensive monitoring programs of this kind were conducted on five occasions: 24-25 June, 6-7, 10-11 and 18-19 August 1976 and 10-11 May 1977.

Sequential C2H2-reduction assays were performed during periods of natural diffuse radiation to avoid the acute problem of excessive elevation of thallus temperature within the incubation bottles that occurs at high levels of irradiance and each assay was begun within 2 min of removing the pseudopodetium from the lichen mat. Thallus temperature within the lichen mat was measured with micro-thermocouples (42 gauge wire) arranged in thermopiles and with the junctions embedded in the main stem of pseudopodetia within the upper 15 mm of the lichen canopy (Fig. A similar method was employed to monitor thallus temperature within the incubation bottles (Fig. 2b) thus providing a check on the extent of deviations from operative temperature in situ. 2b) was measured with a quantum sensor (Lambda Instruments Corporation), and pseudopodetia were weighed on an electrobalance immediately prior to incubation in order that water content could be determined after dry weight estimates had been obtained (Fig.","['In this paper the results of in situ measurements of nitrogenase activity are discussed with particular reference to the problems associated with predictive modelling of N2 fixation by lichens.', '(1971) was used to examine diurnal variation in rates of nitrogenase activity in a S. paschale mat in relation to thallus water content, temperature and incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR-photon flux density in the 400-700 nm wavelength range).']"
504,"Background Social anxiety disorder is one of the most persistent and common anxiety disorders. Individually delivered psychological therapies are the most effective treatment options for adults with social anxiety disorder, but they are associated with high intervention costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the relative cost effectiveness of a variety of psychological and pharmacological interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is common, debilitating and associated with high societal costs. Intervention costs of both treatments are offset by net societal cost reductions in a short time. Published economic analyses have explored the cost-effectiveness of a very limited range of interventions for social anxiety disorder and concluded that escitalopram [53], group CBT [54] [55] [#CITATION_TAG] and computer-based self-help [55] [56] [57] are cost-effective options.",We conducted a 4-year follow-up study of participants who had received ICBT or CBGT for SAD within the context of a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. The cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted taking a societal perspective.,['The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ICBT compared to cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) four years post-treatment.']

149,"Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to various methods of assessing the beat-to-beat variation in the heart over time, in order to draw inference on the outflow of the autonomic nervous system. Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV. Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. In lieu of direct respiratory measures, established algorithms (Moody et al., 1985 (Moody et al.,, 1986) that have been successively improved (e.g., #CITATION_TAG; Langley et al., 2010) can also provide an appropriate surrogate measure of respiration from based on ECG signal morphology.","The whole system consists of two-lead electrocardiogram acquisition using conductive textile electrodes located in bed, baseline fluctuation elimination, R-wave detection, adjustment of sudden change in R-wave area using moving average, and optimal lead selection. In order to solve the problems of previous algorithms for the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal acquisition, we are proposing a method for the optimal lead selection. An optimal EDR signal among the three EDR signals derived from each lead (and arctangent of their ratio) is selected by estimating the instantaneous frequency using the Hilbert transform, and then choosing the signal with minimum variation of the instantaneous frequency.","['In this paper, an improved algorithm for the extraction of respiration signal from the electrocardiogram (ECG) in home healthcare is proposed.']"

Building on social identity theory (e.g., Tajfel, 1978) and social network analysis (e.g., #CITATION_TAG), Paxton (2007, p. 51, italics in original) argues that the generalization of trust beyond a given voluntary association 'is critically dependent on whether an individual belongs to an association that is connected to other associations or one that is isolated'.","We will then move on to Durkheim's organic view of society, to Marx's dialectical materialism, finishing with Weber's Verstehen sociology and ideal types of authority.

809,"Although general anesthetics are thought to modify critical neuronal functions, their impact on neuronal communication has been poorly examined. We have investigated the effect induced by desflurane, a clinically used general anesthetic, on information transfer at the synapse between mossy fibers and granule cells of cerebellum, where this analysis can be carried out extensively. Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called ""bias""). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. MI descends directly from response entropy and noise entropy [13], which are correlated to the variability of responses to separate inputs [13] or to the same input [14] [15] [#CITATION_TAG], respectively.","In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.",['Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text.']

The dominant lichen species at all four sites was Psora decipiens, often occurring with Buellia elegans, Fulgensia bracteata, F. fulgens and Peltigera rufescens. Regional droughts are common in North America, but pan-continental droughts extending across multiple regions, including the 2012 event, are rare relative to single-region events. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the central plains (CP), Southwest (SW), and Southeast (SE) regions experienced drier conditions and increased occurrence of droughts and the Northwest (NW) experienced several extended pluvials. Notably, megadroughts in these regions differed in their timing and persistence, suggesting that they represent regional events influenced by local dynamics rather than a unified, continental-scale phenomena. While relatively rare, pancontinental droughts are present in the paleo record and are linked to defined modes of climate variability, implying the potential for seasonal predictability. Peltigera rufescens, known to have a cyanobacterium as its primary photobiont (#CITATION_TAG), was also found to be associated with chlorobionts (Henskens et al. 2012).","Positive values of the Southern Oscillation index (La Ni~ conditions) are linked to SW, CP, and SE (SW1CP1SE) droughts and SW, CP, and NW (SW1CP1NW) droughts, whereas CP, NW, and SE (CP1NW1SE) droughts are associated with positive values of the Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation.","['Here, the tree-ring-derived North American Drought Atlas is used to investigate drought variability in four regions over the last millennium, focusing on pan-continental droughts.']"

603,"We studied choreographer Wayne McGregor's approach to movement creation through tasking, in which he asks dancers to create movement in response to task instructions that require a great deal of mental imagery and decision making. As part of a programme of research that is developing tools to enhance choreographic practice, an interdisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and dance professionals collaborated on two studies examining the mental representations used to support movement creation. What is the contribution of the extrastriate body area (EBA) to this network? In particular, is the EBA involved in constructing a dynamic representation of observed actions? This region is thought to hold a human body representation (#CITATION_TAG) as well as a dynamic action representation (Downing et al., 2006) that may have contributed to both imagery creation and static movement creation.","Abstract Numerous cortical regions respond to aspects of the human form and its actions. We scanned 16 participants with fMRI while they viewed two kinds of stimulus sequences. In the coherent condition, static frames from a movie of a single, intransitive whole-body action were presented in the correct order. In the incoherent condition, a series of frames from multiple actions (involving one actor) were presented. We suggest that the EBA response adapts when succeeding images depict relatively similar postures (coherent condition) compared to relatively different postures (incoherent condition).","['We propose that the EBA plays a unique role in the perception of action, by representing the static structure, rather than dynamic aspects, of the human form.']"
135,"NEUROENERGETICS Carbohydrate-biased control of energy metabolism: the darker side of the selfish brain Tanya Zilberter* Infotonic Consultancy, Stockholm, Sweden *Correspondence: zilberter@gmail.com IntroductIon There is evidence that the brain favors consumption of carbohydrates (CHO) rather than fats, this preference resulting in glycolysis-based energy metabolism domination. This metabolic mode, typical for consumers of the ""Western diet"" (Cordain et al., 2005; Seneff et al., 2011), is characterized by over-generation of reactive oxygen species and advanced glycation products both of which are implicated in many of the neurodegenerative diseases (Tessier, 2010; Vicente Miranda and Outeiro, 2010; Auburger and Kurz, 2011). However, it is not CHO but fat that is often held responsible for metabolic pathologies. It is general knowledge that the glucose homeostasis possesses very limited buffering capacities, while energy homeostasis in its fat-controlling part enjoys practically unlimited energy stores. the SelfISh BraIn concept: two meanIngS There are two ways to look at the CHObiasing trait of the brain. (1) The ""Selfish Brain"" is a term coined by Robert L. DuPont in the title of his book where he wrote: ""With respect to aggression, fear, feeding, and sexuality, the brain is selfish. The bad news is, in the long run the body can be harmed as the result. They wrote referring to DuPont's book: ""The brain looks after itself first. Such selfishness is reminiscent of an earlier concept in which the brain's selfishness was addressed with respect to addiction. We chose our title by analogy but applied it in a different context, i.e., the competition for energy resources"" (Peters et al., 2004). These two meaning of the Selfish Brain have important common points if we consider the addiction (highly non-homeostatic) as a result of the ""push"" principle borrowed from the economic ""push-pull"" paradigm of supply chains. As early as in 1998, Hill and Peters wrote: ""According to the 'push' principle, the environment pushes excess amounts of energy into the organism"" (Hill and Peters, 1998). According to DuPond, ""What makes a drug addictive is not that it is 'psychoactive' but that it produces specific brain reward. It is not withdrawal that hooks the addict, it is reward"" (DuPont, 2008). This reward is hard-wired in the brain, in the loci where both ""pull"" and ""push"" systems might be converging, something that is discussed within the Selfish Brain paradigm as the comforting effect of food (Peters et al., 2007), particularly, the CHO-rich foods (Hitze et al., 2010). puSh and pull partS of energy Supply control SyStem The role of depots, as determined by a general principle in economic supply chains, is energy buffering in unstable environments (Fischer et al., 2011). The surplus, naturally, goes into depots. Peters and Langemann, however, remained in doubt about this concept partly due to the fact that this ""push"" does not work invariably for all animal or human subjects (Martin et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2011). Indeed, the sizes of CHO and fat depots are incomparable. Among the most frequently reported consequences of HFD are features typical for metabolic syndrome - increased hunger/appetite, insulin resistance, elevated body fat deposition, and glucose intolerance along with decreased neuronal resistance to damaging conditions. The metabolic state caused by KD (Figure 1C) was called ""unique"" (Kennedy et al., 2007) and it closely resembles effects of calorie restriction (Domouzoglou and MaratosFlier, 2011). the KetogenIc ratIo and the ""puSh"" component of energy metaBolISm The environment in Western-type societies can be characterized as ""pushing"" the energy into our organisms via activation of reward and addiction circuits of our selfish brains. In the standard experimental ""Western Diet"" (5TJN) with KR close to 1:1, CHO proportion is high enough to continuously maintain glycolysis, overconsumption, and the subsequent chain of events resulting in metabolic disturbances detrimental for the brain (Langdon et al., 2011). The NHANES surveys of 1971-2006 (Austin et al., 2011) revealed that in the USA population, the trend toward increased CHO intake and decreased fat intake (KR shift from 0.716 to 0.620) resulted in the increase of obesity But why, then, it is the dietary fat that is blamed for overconsumption, obesity, and neuro-deteriorating effects? the role of macronutrIent compoSItIon Interestingly, the diet categorization (HFD, low-CHO, KD, etc.) A century ago, Woodyatt wrote: ""antiketogenesis is an effect due to certain products which occur in the oxidation of glucose, an interaction between these products on the one hand and one or more of the acetone bodies on the other"" (Woodyatt, 1910). Wilder and Winter (1922) defined the threshold of ketogenesis explaining it from the standpoint of condition where either ketone bodies or glucose can be oxidized. This is a very important point, not only methodologically, but also ideologically. On the other hand, ketogenesis introduces a fuel alternative to glucose, which can be crucial in metabolic pathologies. water-vitamin fast, with body fat as a sole energy source, has been reported (Stewart and Fleming, 1973). non-homeoStatIc effectS of cho verSuS fat From the teleological standpoint, the strong drive for CHO intake beyond homeostatic needs exists very likely due to limited CHOstoring capacities. For fat with its vast depots, there is less (or none at all) evidence for a drive of similar magnitude. Oral stimulation with both sweet and non-sweet CHO activated brain regions associated with reward - insula/frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. In humans, the intra-amniotic injection of fat (Lipiodol) reduced fetal drinking, while injection of sodium saccharin stimulated it; infants consumed the same amounts of milk formulas with different fat contents. CHO-rich food intake (buffet, KR 0.511:1) relieved neuroglycopenic and mood responses to stress independently from oral or i.v. administration of energy (Hitze et al., 2010). Besides, HFD often fails in inducing obesity. Consequently, it is not uncommon in diet-induced obesity experiments that obesity-resistant subjects are eliminated from analysis or CHO are added to the diet to encourage overeating. To sum it up, fat per se is neither as highly rewarding as CHO nor it is as addictive (Wojnicki et al., 2008; Avena et al., 2009; Pickering et al., 2009; Berthoud et al., 2011).

Lowcarbohydrate diets: what are the potential short- and long-term health implications? However, this is possible only in deterministic environments. In variable environments, energy storage becomes advantageous and approximately equal parts of energy are allocated for maintenance, reproduction, and depots (Fischer et al., 2011). Energy intake beyond rigid homeostatic regulation relies on behaviors with hedonic, rewarding, and addictive nuances more characteristic for CHO than for fat. To maximize energy stores, energy intake relies on CHO-driven behaviors to allow the environmental ""push."" In a recent article entitled ""Using Marketing Muscle to Sell Fat: The Rise of Obesity in the Modern Economy,"" J. Zimmerman wrote: ""In this paradigm, overeating results from more extensive advertising, new product development, increased portion sizes, and other tactics of food marketers that have caused shifts in the underlying demand for total food calories"" (Zimmerman, 2011). On the other hand, the diets with KR of 2:1 or higher are repeatedly described as metabolically beneficial, non-addictive, hunger-reducing, and neuroprotective (Figure 1A).

The role of glyoxalases for sugar stress and aging, with relevance for dyskinesia, anxiety, dementia and Parkinson's disease. The ability to store energy enables organisms to deal with temporarily harsh and uncertain conditions. Empirical studies have demonstrated that organisms adapted to fluctuating energy availability plastically adjust their storage strategies. So far, however, theoretical studies have investigated general storage strategies only in constant or deterministically varying environments. In environments with low variability and low predictability of energy availability, it is not optimal to store energy. As environments become more variable or more predictable, energy allocation to storage is increasingly favoured. The role of depots, as determined by a general principle in economic supply chains, is energy buffering in unstable environments (#CITATION_TAG).","By varying environmental variability, environmental predictability, and the cost of survival, we obtain a variety of different optimal life-history strategies, from highly iteroparous to semelparous, which differ significantly in their storage patterns.","['In this study, we analyze how the ability to store energy influences optimal energy allocation to storage, reproduction, and maintenance in environments in which energy availability varies stochastically.']"
719,"Many energy system optimization studies show that hydrogen may be an important part of an optimal decarbonisation mix, but such analyses are unable to examine the uncertainties associated with breaking the 'locked-in' nature of incumbent systems. Uncertainties around technical learning rates; consumer behaviour; and the strategic interactions of governments, automakers and fuel providers are particularly acute. System dynamics and agent-based models, and studies of historical alternative fuel transitions, have furthered our understanding of possible transition dynamics, but these types of analysis exclude broader systemic issues concerning energy system evolution (e.g. supplies and prices of low-carbon energy) and the politics of transitions. This paper presents a hybrid approach to assessing hydrogen transitions in the UK, by linking qualitative scenarios with quantitative energy systems modelling using the UK MARKAL model.

1014,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Death is often preceded by medical decisions that potentially shorten life (end-of-life decisions [ELDs]), for example, the decision to withhold or withdraw treatment. Almost all of the incompetent patients had previously stated that they wanted their family involved in case of incompetence, but half did not achieve this.In half of the cases, advanced lung cancer patients-or their families in cases of incompetence-were not involved in ELD making, despite the wishes of most of them. Physicians should openly discuss ELDs and involvement preferences with their advanced lung cancer patients.Copyright A(c) 2012 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

These variants differ in the way the exchange interactions are treated. This is a consequence of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), which establishes a general relationship between the (equilibrium) internal autocorrelation C(t) of fluctuations of some observable of the system in the absence of the disturbance and the (non-equilibrium) response R(t) of a system to small external perturbations (#CITATION_TAG).","One of these variants, named dRPA-II, is original to this work and closely resembles the second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) method. We discuss and clarify the connections among different RPA formulations. We derive the spin-adapted forms of all the variants for closed-shell systems and test them on a few atomic and molecular systems with and without range separation of the electron electron interaction.",['ABSTRACT:We explore several random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energy variants within the adiabatic-connection fluctuationdissipation theorem approach.']
257,"Several variant RARA translocations have been reported in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) of which the t(11;17)(q23;q21), which results in a ZBTB16-RARA fusion, is the most widely identified and is largely resistant to therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is typified by the t(15;17) translocation, which leads to the formation of the PML/RARA fusion gene and predicts a beneficial response to retinoids. However, approximately 10% of all APL cases lack the classic t(15;17). To address this issue, a European workshop was held in Monza, Italy, during June 1997, and a morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular review was undertaken in 60 cases of APL lacking t(15;17). This process led to the development of a novel morphologic classification system that takes into account the major nuclear and cytoplasmic features of APL. The bone marrow morphology of patients with ZBTB16-RARA APL tends to be distinct from those patients with either classical or the hypogranular variant of APL [#CITATION_TAG].","This group includes (1) cases with cryptic PML/RARA gene rearrangements and t(5;17) that leads to the NPM/RARA fusion gene, which are retinoid-responsive, and (2) cases with t(11;17)(q23;q21) that are associated with the PLZF/RARA fusion gene, which are retinoid-resistant.",['A key issue is how to rapidly distinguish subtypes of APL that demand distinct treatment approaches.']

594,"Background: Cancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of mutations, but not all orders of accumulation are equally likely. When the fixation of some mutations depends on the presence of previous ones, identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations can lead to the discovery of therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Having to filter passengers lead to decreased performance, especially because true restrictions were missed. Evolutionary model and deviations from order restrictions had major, and sometimes counterintuitive, interactions with other factors that affected performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the performance of all available methods to identify these restrictions from cross-sectional data. In solid tumours, data on genetic alterations are  usually only available at a single point in time, allowing no direct insight into the  sequential order of genetic events. Another early model are distancebased trees [17, #CITATION_TAG], but their meaning is rather different, since the observed mutations are only placed in the leaves or terminal nodes of the tree, and the internal nodes are unobserved and unknown events, which precludes an interpretation in terms of order restrictions like ""mutation A is required for mutation B"".","In our approach, genetic tumour development  and progression is assumed to follow a probabilistic tree model. We show how  maximum likelihood estimation can be used to reconstruct a tree model for the  dependencies between genetic alterations in a given tumour type. We illustrate the  use of the proposed method by applying it to cytogenetic data from 173 cases of  clear cell renal cell carcinoma, arriving at a model for the karyotypic evolution of  this tumour",['We present a new approach for modelling the dependencies between of genetic  changes in human tumours.']
906,"ail addresses: goergenm@cardiff.ac.uk (M. Go a b s t r a c t There is a growing controversy as to the impact of private equity acquisitions, especially in terms of their impact on employment and subsequent organizational performance. It has been suggested that closer owner supervision and the injection of a new management team revitalize the acquired organization and unlock dormant capabilities and value. However, both politicians and trade unionists suggest that private equity acquirers may significantly reallocate value away from employees to short term investors, typically through layoffs and reduced wages, which may undermine future organizational sustainability. This article investigates this in the context of a sample of institutional buy outs (IBOs) undertaken in the UK between 1997 and 2006. (2001, 2002) in investigating the employment consequences of regular takeovers. Despite the establishment of significant traditions of emotion research in many disciplines, there has been little discussion of the state and potential of the archaeological study of emotion. In archaeology, both the sociobiological approach and one based on empathy have serious problems. Finally, institutional buy outs (IBOs) involve private equity and other institutional investors; here managers do not hold any shares at all, unless this is part of their reward package (#CITATION_TAG).","After reviewing and rejecting the dichotomy between emotions as entirely biological, universal, and hard-wired, on one hand, and entirely social and constructed, on the other, a view of emotions as historically specific and experientially embedied is advanced.","['This paper aims to review archaeological approaches to emotion-to assess the significance of existing studies and outline the potential for the incorporation of emotion into archaeological research.', 'It argues that the study of emotion in the past is both necessary and possible ; it considers which understandings of emotion we might find most useful, how the archaeology of emotion might be carried out, and what are the most promising avenues to explore.']"

274,"Developments in immunological and quantitative real-time PCR-based analysis have enabled the detection, enumeration, and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). It is assumed that the detection of CTCs is associated with cancer, based on the finding that CTCs can be detected in all major cancer and not in healthy subjects or those with benign disease. Patients with chronic prostatitis may have circulating prostate cells detected in blood, which do not express the enzyme P504S and should be thought of as benign in nature. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type, and third highest in mortality rates among cancer-related deaths in the United States. Originating from intestinal epithelial cells in the colon and rectum, that are impacted by numerous factors including genetics, environment and chronic, lingering inflammation, CRC can be a problematic malignancy to treat when detected at advanced stages. Chemotherapeutic agents serve as the historical first line of defense in the treatment of metastatic CRC. In recent years, however, combinational treatment with targeted therapies, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, has proven to be quite effective in patients with specific CRC subtypes.

To significantly impact biological research, notably in developing novel therapeutics, it is critical that the model adequately represents the captured system. We propose an approach based on argumentation from safety-critical systems engineering, where a system is subjected to a stringent analysis of compliance against identified criteria. Influencing more environmentally friendly and sustainable behaviour is a current focus of many projects, ranging from government social marketing campaigns, education and tax structures to designers' work on interactive products, services and environments. These approaches make different assumptions about 'what people are like': how users will respond to behavioural interventions, and why, and in the process reveal some of the assumptions that designers and other stakeholders, such as clients commissioning a project, make about human nature. While much focus has been given to the release of software tools that aid researchers in developing and analysing computational models [#CITATION_TAG][9][10][11][12][13], the same attention has not been given to providing researchers with a means of showing that their developed tool can adequately support the investigation of a specific biological research question: that the tool is fit for purpose.","There is a wide variety of techniques and methods used, intended to work via different sets of cognitive and environmental principles. The models are characterised using systems terminology and the application of each model to design for sustainable behaviour is examined via a series of examples.","[""This paper discusses three simple models of user behaviour - the pinball, the shortcut and the thoughtful - which emerge from user experience designers' statements about users while focused on designing for behaviour change.""]"

221,"First, there was excessive maturity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehicles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. In thinking about regulatory reform, one must therefore go beyond considerations of individual incentives and supervision and pay attention to issues of systemic interdependence and transparency. The paper analyses the causes of the current crisis of the global financial system, with particular emphasis on the systemic elements that turned the crisis of subprime mortgage-backed securities in the United States, a small part of the overall system, into a worldwide crisis. The paper argues that these developments have not only been caused by identifiably faulty decisions, but also by flaws in financial system architecture. Diversification within an intermediary serves to reduce these costs, even in a risk neutral economy. 24 In the theory of financial institutions, therefore, the paradigmatic model of viable financial intermediation, due to #CITATION_TAG, postulates an intermediary holding a fully diversified portfolio of assets, with outside finance taking entirely the form of debt, with claims that are independent of the returns which the intermediary earns on his portfolio: If the claims on the financial intermediary are independent of returns on the intermediary's assets and if diversification ensures that the probability of default is zero, any benefits of taking greater effort in managing assets, e.g., more thorough monitoring of loans clients, accrue entirely to the intermediary.",It presents a characterization of the costs of providing incentives for delegated monitoring by a financial intermediary.,"['This paper develops a theory of financial intermediation based on minimizing the cost of monitoring information which is useful for resolving incentive problems between borrowers and lenders.', 'The paper presents some more general analysis of the effect of diversification on resolving incentive problems.']"

In addition, the games and hand-held platforms differ in their ability to handle degraded wireless network conditions and in the amount of broadcast traffic sent. Employment laws in India and Zimbabwe require employers to obtain permission from the government to retrench or lay off workers. However, in both countries a substantial decline in the demand for employees (other things equal) followed the new legislation. In Zimbabwe it is difficult to be precise about a causal connection between the drop in the demand for labor (allowing for concurrent increased wages) and the new legislation because enactment occurred simultaneously with Independence; however, the current economic climate induced high levels of investment in capital but not investments in long-term commitments to employees. Upon achieving independence in 1980, the government of Zimbabwe passed a new Employment Act, requiring employers to obtain permission from the Ministry of Labor to fire or lay off workers. Comparable regulations were imposed in India by the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act of 1976, requiring that written permission be obtained, normally from the relevant state government, either to close a plant or to retrench workers. Any addition to economic security in the lives of workers is clearly a laudable goal in its own right. But the question addressed in this article is whether these particular job security regulations have had undesirable side effects, which may even have thwarted the original goals of the legislation.

Individually delivered psychological therapies are the most effective treatment options for adults with social anxiety disorder, but they are associated with high intervention costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the relative cost effectiveness of a variety of psychological and pharmacological interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder. There are other medication classes with demonstrated efficacy in social phobia (benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, alpha-2-delta ligands), but due to limited published clinical trial data and the potential for dependence and withdrawal issues with benzodiazepines, it is unclear how best to incorporate these drugs into treatment regimens. There are very few clinical trials on the use of combined medications. There is some evidence, albeit limited to certain drug classes, that the combination of medication and cognitive behavior therapy may be more effective than either strategy used alone.

Insight into the experiences and wishes of people with dementia regarding advance directives is totally lacking in empirical research. It is clear, however, that the use of advance directives in practice remains problematic, above all in cases of advance euthanasia directives, but to a lesser extent also when non-treatment directives are involved. The peasant families of the Río Auqui watershed cultivate an average area of around 3 hectares per family which are distributed in small plots over different altitudes of the valley (Fig. 1) in order to guarantee diversified production for each family (Sietz et al., 2012; #CITATION_TAG; Zimmerer, 2011).",Methods: The relevant problems from the ethical debate on advance directives in cases of dementia are summarized and we discuss how these relate to what is known from empirical research on the validity and effectiveness of advance directives in the clinical practice of dementia care.,"['This paper assesses the contribution of advance directives to decision-making in the care of people with dementia, with a special focus on non-treatment directives and directives for euthanasia.']"
939,"Tensor models are the generalization of matrix models, and are studied as models of quantum gravity in general dimensions. The algebraic structure is studied mainly from the perspective of 3-ary algebras. In this paper, I discuss the algebraic structure in the fuzzy space interpretation of the tensor models which have a tensor with three indices as its only dynamical variable. These generalizations are algebraic structures in which the two entries Lie bracket has been replaced by a bracket with n entries. Three-Lie algebras have surfaced recently in multi-brane theory in the context of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model. In the sequel, it is found that 3-ary algebras [#CITATION_TAG] [28] [29] describe the symmetries of the tensor models.","Each type of n-ary bracket satisfies a specific characteristic identity which plays the r\^ole of the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras. Particular attention will be paid to generalized Lie algebras, which are defined by even multibrackets obtained by antisymmetrizing the associative products of its n components and that satisfy the generalized Jacobi identity (GJI), and to Filippov (or n-Lie) algebras, which are defined by fully antisymmetric n-brackets that satisfy the Filippov identity (FI). Because of this, Filippov algebras will be discussed at length, including the cohomology complexes that govern their central extensions and their deformations (Whitehead's lemma extends to all semisimple n-Lie algebras). When the skewsymmetry of the n-Lie algebra is relaxed, one is led the n-Leibniz algebras. The standard Poisson structure may also be extended to the n-ary case. We shall review here the even generalized Poisson structures, whose GJI reproduces the pattern of the generalized Lie algebras, and the Nambu-Poisson structures, which satisfy the FI and determine Filippov algebras.",['This paper reviews the properties and applications of certain n-ary generalizations of Lie algebras in a self-contained and unified way.']

It was also shown in few cases that SNARE on the target membrane (t-SNARE) with a fusogenic role, can become non-fusogenic when overexpressed. SNARE ABUNDANCE AND INFLUENCE OF DISTRIBUTION ON THEIR FUSOGENIC ROLE SNAREs are relatively small polypeptides (~200-400-amino-acids) characterized by the presence of a particular domain, the SNARE motif (Jahn and Scheller, 2006), consisting of heptad repeats that can form a coiled-coil structure. Via heterooligomeric interactions, these proteins form highly stable protein-protein interactions organized in a SNARE-complex that help to overcome the energy barrier required for membrane fusion. Even after considering all these potential interactors, in living cells, most SNARE molecules are apparently present in excess and concentrated in clusters, thus constituting a spare pool not readily available for interactions. About the alteration of SNARE function, it is essential to remember that antibodies or recombinant SNARE fragments, showing inhibitory or dominant negative (DN) effect, for example, on syntaxin 13 (Bethani et al., 2009), induce effects that are very different: antibodies cause the depletion of active domains while SNARE fragments cause the competitive saturation of the interacting partners. SNAREs (precisely t-SNAREs) have been visualized to form apparent clusters using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. This inhomogeneous distribution was initially proposed to provide a localized pool of t-SNAREs to facilitate and enhance membranes fusion (van den Bogaart et al., 2011) but recently, using super-resolution microscopy techniques, Yang and coworkers (2012) showed that secretory vesicles were preferentially targeted to membrane areas with a low density of SNAREs. Vesicles do not preferentially target these microdomains. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro-domains and the t-SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions (Yang et al., 2012). Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (Silva et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52 a double localization associated to two different functions (De Benedictis et al., 2012). Also in Petunia hybrida, the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now (Faraco, 2011) seems to define in petal epidermal cells a very well defined vacuolar compartments separated from www.frontiersin.org April 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 99 | 1 the central vacuole and already observed with other vacuolar markers (Verweij et al., 2008). The discovery of new structural roles for SNAREs, eventually related to the interaction with still unknown partners, may shed light on vacuolar complex organization and it is not surprising that results about vacuolar SNAREs still appear contradictory. Bethani and co-workers (2009) discussed interesting points proving SNARE specificity. Little attention is generally paid to the need of the cell to keep very similar compartments separated, because this need may not be evident among endosomes as much as among larger vacuolar structures typical of only few plant cells (Epimashko et al., 2004; Verweij et al., 2008). Proteolipidic composition appears determinant (Strasser et al., 2011). From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (Strasser et al., 2011). It is extremely interesting a recent report on SNAREs interaction with proteolipid (Di Giovanni et al., 2010). It was suggested that this interaction had the effect to concentrate SNAREs in some areas to enhance their fusogenic potential but it is now evident that more regulatory events than simple localization is involved. i-SNAREs At the moment, in plants, it was observed that SYP21 (Foresti et al., 2006), SYP51, and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) inhibit vacuolar traffic when overexpressed. Varlamov and co-workers (2004) suggested that non-fusogenic SNARE complexes, including the i-SNARE partners, have the physiological function at the level of the Golgi apparatus to increase the polarity of this organelle. Mammalian and yeast i-SNAREs (syntaxin 6/Tlg1, GS15/Sft1, and rBet1/Bet1) were found functionally conserved but i-SNARE characterization in plants is still poor. A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins (Izawa et al., 2012) and because of their ability to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011). More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (Grefen et al., 2010). The speculations about the mechanism active in plant cells can include the mechanisms elucidated in yeast cells with the exception that in S. cerevisiae a single Qc-SNARE is active at each step but more than one are active in plants. Several sorting processes may be influenced by the higher concentration of specific SNAREs but the phenomena are simply not yet correlated. SNAREs can also be specifically localized and active as t-SNARE on intermediate compartments, such as for example SYP61, localized on the TGN membranes (2). The compartments indicated in the figure are generic; their identity may change in different experimental systems and in differentiated cells. pollen tubes (Wang et al., 2011) where SYP5s are expressed at higher levels than in all other tissues (Lipka et al., 2007; De Benedictis et al., 2012). The equilibrium between fusogenic (tSNARE) and non fusogenic (i-SNARE) activity of specific SNAREs may reside on their localization, as highlighted for SYP51 and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) but also on the formation of ""clusters"" in cholesterol-containing microdomains (Sieber et al., 2006, 2007). In this manuscript I discuss data obtained in various eukaryotic models that leave open different possibilities for the action mechanism of the i-SNAREs in plants. It supported the idea that a small number of SNAREs is needed to drive a single fusion event and that the proteins not engaged in classic fusion events are maintained, by yet undefined mechanisms, in membrane micro-domains with a non-random molecular composition. These have been proposed to belong to a new functional class of SNAREs (Varlamov et al., 2004). The continuous polarized vesicle secretion in pollen tubes is essential for tip growth but the location of endo- and exocytic sub-domains remains however controversial. The specific distribution of SYP124 at the plasma membrane is affected by changes in Ca2+ levels in agreement with the importance of this ion for exocytosis. Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (#CITATION_TAG; Yang et al., 2012).",,"['In this report we aimed to show that Arabidopsis thaliana syntaxins are involved in this process and contribute to spatially define exocytosis and membrane recycling.Using GFP-fusion constructs, we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific (AtSYP124) and non-pollen syntaxins (AtSYP121 and AtSYP122) in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes.']"
295,"Lipids comprise the bulk of the dry mass of the brain. In addition to providing structural integrity to membranes, insulation to cells and acting as a source of energy, lipids can be rapidly converted to mediators of inflammation or to signaling molecules that control molecular and cellular events in the brain. The advent of soft ionization procedures such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) have made it possible for compositional studies of the diverse lipid structures that are present in brain. These include phospholipids, ceramides, sphingomyelin, cerebrosides, cholesterol and their oxidized derivatives. These proteins may be potential therapeutic targets since they transport lipids required for neuronal growth or convert lipids into molecules that control brain physiology. In this review, we examine the structure of the major lipid classes in the brain, describe methods used for their characterization, and evaluate their role in neurological diseases. The potential utility of characterizing lipid markers in the brain, with specific emphasis on disease mechanisms, will be discussed. Combining lipidomics and proteomics will enhance existing knowledge of disease pathology and increase the likelihood of discovering specific markers and biochemical mechanisms of brain diseases. Abstract: Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the name for the class of lipolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the acyl group from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, generating free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. The products of the PLA2-catalyzed reaction can potentially act as second messengers themselves, or be further metabolized to eicosanoids, platelet-activating factor, and lysophosphatidic acid. The presence of PLA2 in the central nervous system, accompanied by the relatively large quantity of potential substrate, poses an interesting dilemma as to the role PLA2 has during both physiologic and pathologic states. Several different PLA2 enzymes exist in brain, some of which have been partially characterized. However, under pathological situations, increased PLA2 activity may result in the loss of essential membrane glycerophospholipids, resulting in altered membrane permeability, ion homeostasis, increased free fatty acid release, and the accumulation of lipid peroxides. These processes, along with loss of ATP, may be responsible for the loss of membrane phospholipid and subsequent neuronal injury found in ischemia, spinal cord injury, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The incorporation of PUFAs into phospholipid subclasses is highly choreographed such that most PUFAs are initially incorporated into 1,2-diacyl phospholipids subclasses before they are remodeled into the ether-linked phospholipids classes by coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent or CoA-independent transacylase activities [#CITATION_TAG, 84, 126, 165, 167].","They are classified into two subtypes, CA2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent, based on their catalytic dependence on Ca2+.",['This review outlines the current knowledge of the PLA2 found in the central nervous system and attempts to define the role of PLA2 during both physiologic and pathologic conditions.']
975,"Coronal loops are the building blocks of the X-ray bright solar corona. They owe their brightness to the dense confined plasma, and this review focuses on loops mostly as structures confining plasma. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered and, therefore, topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones, which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with separate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. However, it is unclear how often training should be performed to maximize its benefit. The present study investigated how the frequency of training contributed to normal-hearing listeners' adaptation to spectrally shifted speech. Although more frequent training may accelerate listeners' adaptation to spectrally shifted speech, there may be significant benefits from training as little as one session per week. It has been shown that time-dependent loop models must include a relatively thick, cool, and dense chromosphere and the transition region for a correct description of the mass transfer driven by transient heating (e.g., #CITATION_TAG) and to maintain the necessary numerical stability (Antiochos, 1979; Hood and Priest, 1980; Peres et al., 1982).","Methods: Eighteen normal-hearing listeners were trained with spectrally shifted and compressed speech via an 8-channel acoustic simulation of cochlear implant speech processing.

Subjects were trained to identify medial vowels presented in a cVc format; depending on the level of difficulty, the number of response choices was increased and/or the acoustic differences between vowels were reduced. Vowel and consonant recognition was measured before and after training as well as at regular intervals during the training period.

Learning analytics is an evolving discipline with capability for educational data analysis that could enable better understanding of learning process, and therefore mitigate these challenges. This study reviewed factors that could be used to predict academic performance, but which are currently not systematically measured in tertiary education. It focused on psychometric factors of ability, personality, motivation, and learning strategies. Evidence-centered design (ECD) is a comprehensive framework for describing the conceptual, computational and inferential elements of educational assessment.

449,"Processing of linear word order (linear configuration) is important for virtually all languages and essential to languages such as English which have little functional morphology. Damage to systems underpinning configurational processing may specifically affect word-order reliant sentence structures. We explore order processing in WR, a man with primary progressive aphasia. An important topic in the evolution of language is the kinds of grammars that can be computed by humans and other animals. Fitch and Hauser (F&H; 2004) approached this question by assessing the ability of different species to learn 2 grammars, (AB)(n) and A(n) B(n) . This article replicates F&H's data and reports new controls using either categories similar to those in F&H or less salient ones. Indeed, when familiarized with A(n) B(n) exemplars, participants failed to discriminate A(3) B(2) and A(2) B(3) from A(n) B(n) items, missing the crucial feature that the number of As must equal the number of Bs. There is strong evidence, including from self-reports after the experiment, that participants who learn non-configurational properties do so by counting and comparing the number of stimuli of each class, and participants without syntactic disorder more consistently attend to configurational (order) than nonconfigurational (counting) structure (de Vries, Monaghan, Knecht, & Zwitserlood, 2008; #CITATION_TAG; Perruchet & Rey, 2005;.

1024,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Since its first publication in 2003, the World Health Organization's ""Safe abortion: technical and policy guidance for health systems"" has had an influence on abortion policy, law, and practice worldwide.

486,"Throughout Earth's history, life has increased greatly in abundance, complexity, and diversity. At the same time, it has substantially altered the Earth's environment, evolving some of its variables to states further and further away from thermodynamic equilibrium. For instance, concentrations in atmospheric oxygen have increased throughout Earth's history, resulting in an increased chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere as well as an increased redox gradient between the atmosphere and the Earth's reducing crust. This is applied to the processes of planet Earth to characterize the generation and transfer of free energy and its dissipation, from radiative gradients to temperature and chemical potential gradients that result in chemical, kinetic, and potential free energy and associated dynamics of the climate system and geochemical cycles. Here, I present this hierarchical thermodynamic theory of the Earth system. This perspective allows us to view life as being the means to transform many aspects of planet Earth to states even further away from thermodynamic equilibrium than is possible by purely abiotic means. In this perspective pockets of low-entropy life emerge from the overall trend of the Earth system to increase the entropy of the universe at the fastest possible rate. International audienceAfter a career as a chemist and engineer, James Lovelock proposed the Gaia hypothesis in the 1970's with Lynn Margulis, a biologist. From the beginning Lovelock saw Gaia as a grand idea, challenging the way biology and geology should be carried out, and up to our very conception of nature. This chapter recalls the rich context in which the hypothesis was elaborated in the 1960's and 1970's. Wheras evolutionary biologists ridiculed it as a pseudo-metaphor comparing the Earth with an organism, Gais has generated new research programs in the Earth sciences and has been embraced by the environmental counterculture as a new conception of nature and of our relationships with the Earth The resulting view of the Earth system is then compared to the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock [40, #CITATION_TAG, 30] and the role of human activity in the global work budget is being discussed.",It then traces Gaia's contrasted reception.,['The hypothesis highlights the important influence that living beings have on their geological environment to speculate about the possibility of a regulation of the planetary environment.']

64,"Health promotion is essential to improve the health status and quality of life of individuals. Promoting mental health at an individual, community and policy level is central to reducing the incidence of mental health problems, including self-harm and suicide. Men may be particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, in part because they are less likely to seek help from healthcare professionals. Although this article discusses mental health promotion and related strategies in general, the focus is on men's mental health. BACKGROUND There is a growing body of research in the United States to suggest that men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals for problems as diverse as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities and stressful life events. Previous research has revealed that the principle health related issue facing men in the UK is their reluctance to seek access to health services. However, the growing body of gender-specific studies highlights a trend of delayed help seeking when they become ill. A prominent theme among white middle class men implicates ""traditional masculine behaviour"" as an explanation for delays in seeking help among men who experience illness. The reasons and processes behind this issue, however, have received limited attention. The effects of health problems may be compounded by different approaches to seeking help between men and women, with men seeking help less frequently than women (#CITATION_TAG), particularly for psychological problems (Smith et al 2006).","METHOD The investigation of men's health-related help seeking behaviour has great potential for improving both men and women's lives and reducing national health costs through the development of responsive and effective interventions.

218,"First, there was excessive maturity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehicles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. In thinking about regulatory reform, one must therefore go beyond considerations of individual incentives and supervision and pay attention to issues of systemic interdependence and transparency. The paper analyses the causes of the current crisis of the global financial system, with particular emphasis on the systemic elements that turned the crisis of subprime mortgage-backed securities in the United States, a small part of the overall system, into a worldwide crisis. The paper argues that these developments have not only been caused by identifiably faulty decisions, but also by flaws in financial system architecture. This supplement to the Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics presents material from a conference on Capital Adequacy Rules as Instruments for the Regulation of Banks, which took place in Basle on July 5, 1996. As such it complements the December 1995 supplement, which presented papers from a conference on the same subject a year earlier. The area of banking regulation has not always been marked by intense interaction between academics and practitioners. Indeed, from the times of Regulation Q to the enactment of the 1988 Basle Accord on Capital Adequacy Requirements for Credit Risks, it has been an area where people were sure of their views, with little need to listen to each other. At the same time, not much academic research was actually done in the area; this has only changed with the various banking crises of the eighties and early nineties and the tightening of capital adequacy regulation of banks following the Basle Accord. However the certainties of yesteryear are disappearing. This is most obvious in the development of proposals to extend the 1988 Basle Accord to market risks. When the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision presented the first such proposal in April 1993, it seemed that the regulatory train was moving full speed ahead on a track built by traditional practice, with little analysis of the likely economic effects of the proposed measures. However the industry's reactions then made it clear that conceptually and procedurally this proposal was lagging behind some of the approaches to risk measurement and risk management that had been developed by financial institutions themselves. Because of these reactions, the Basle Committee's revised proposal of April 1995 allowed for the possibility that capital adequacy requirements for banks bearing market risks be based on the banks' own risk models rather than any exogenously set, rigid regulatory standard. #CITATION_TAG compares ""the speed with which the regulatory community moved from the April 1993 and April 1995 proposals to the actual Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks of January 1996 to the time and expenses it takes for a private company to get a new drug approved for sale"" and notes that ""both the 1988 Accord and the 1996 Amendment to the 1988 Accord were enacted with hardly any evidence about the economic effects of capital requirements for banks.""","Both conferences were organized by NlKLAUS BLATTNER, of the University of Basle, and myself.","['Their purpose was partly to present results from an ongoing joint research project and partly to stimulate some interaction of discussion of banking regulation between academics, bankers, and regulators (in alphabetical order).']"

We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change.

We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading.","[""In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged.""]"
354,"Background Unassisted cessationquitting without pharmacological or professional supportis an enduring phenomenon. Unassisted cessation persists even in nations advanced in tobacco control where cessation assistance such as nicotine replacement therapy, the stop-smoking medications bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural assistance are readily available. We review the qualitative literature on the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted. Motivation, although widely reported, had only one clear meaning, that is 'the reason for quitting'. Commitment was equated to seriousness or resoluteness, was perceived as key to successful quitting, and was often used to distinguish earlier failed quit attempts from the final successful quit attempt. Commitment had different dimensions. Increasing rates of smoking cessation is one of the most effective measures available to improve population health. Younger quitters were more likely to use unassisted methods such as cold turkey; older or less educated quitters were more likely to use assisted methods such as prescribed medication or advice from a general practitioner.The majority of recent quitters quit cold turkey or cut down before quitting, and reported that these methods were helpful.

896,"The data stems from studies of searchers interaction with an XML information retrieval system. In this paper we present findings from a comparative study of data collected from client and server side loggings. The purpose is to see what factors of effort can be captured from the two logging methods. Charcoal records from lake sediment and fire-scar networks from long-lived tree species have improved our understanding of long-term relationships between fire events and climate. This work has primarily focused on historically fire-prone ecosystems and regions. In the northeastern USA, where wildfire has been relatively infrequent in historical times, fire-risk assessments have incorporated little-to-no pre-historical data and little is known about long-term fire-climate relationships. However, although prolonged droughts were widespread and associated with higher probability of fire, the fire events were rarely synchronous among sites, with the exception of ~550 years before present (yr BP) when all three sites experienced both drought and fire. While fire has been relatively uncommon in the northeastern USA during the past century, our records clearly highlight the potential vulnerability of the region to future drought and fire impacts. Numerous studies have been performed on searchers' interaction with IR systems, in non-web systems [1] [2] [3], but in particular with the advent of the Web [#CITATION_TAG] [5] [6].","We developed coupled, high-resolution records of moisture variability and fire from three ombrotrophic peatlands in Maine using testate amoebae and analysis of microscopic charcoal.","['Understanding the role of fire in the Earth system, and particularly regional controls on its frequency and severity, is critical to risk assessment.']"
126,"Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk obtained through bioclimatic envelope models calibrated with native species distribution data can play a critical role in invasive species management. Forecasts of invasion risk to novel environments, however, remain controversial. Only when incorporating a measure of human modification of habitats within the native range do bioclimatic envelope models yield credible predictions of invasion risk for parakeets across Europe. Invasion risk derived from models that account for differing niche requirements of phylogeographic lineages and those that do not achieve similar statistical accuracy, but there are pronounced differences in areas predicted to be susceptible for invasion. Aim To mitigate the threat invasive species pose to ecosystem functioning, reliable risk assessment is paramount. Understanding how biotic and environmental factors facilitate their invasion success remains a challenge. Indeed, variance in laying dates between European and native (Asian) parakeet populations suggests that in Europe, parakeets are delaying their breeding in response to colder temperatures (#CITATION_TAG).","Here, we assess the role of two major hypotheses explaining invasion success: (1) enemy-release, which argues that invasive species are freed from their native predators and parasites in the new areas; and (2) climate-matching, which argues that the climatic similarity between the exotic and native range determines the success of invasive populations.",['Aim  Some invasive species succeed particularly well and manage to establish populations across a wide variety of regions and climatic conditions.']

572,"Much bioethical scholarship is concerned with the social, legal and philosophical implications of new and emerging science and medicine, as well as with the processes of research that under-gird these innovations. Science and technology studies (STS), and the related and interpenetrating disciplines of anthropology and sociology, have also explored what novel technoscience might imply for society, and how the social is constitutive of scientific knowledge and technological artefacts. More recently, social scientists have interrogated the emergence of ethical issues: they have documented how particular matters come to be regarded as in some way to do with 'ethics', and how this in turn enjoins particular types of social action. In sum, engagements between STS and bioethics are increasingly important in order to understand and manage the complex dynamics between science, medicine and ethics in society. In this paper, I will discuss some of this and other STS (and STS-inflected) literature and reflect on how it might complement more 'traditional' modes of bioethical enquiry. The use of Ritalin and other stimulant drug treatments for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) raises distinctive moral dilemmas for parents; these moral dilemmas have not been adequately addressed in the bioethics literature.

To significantly impact biological research, notably in developing novel therapeutics, it is critical that the model adequately represents the captured system. We propose an approach based on argumentation from safety-critical systems engineering, where a system is subjected to a stringent analysis of compliance against identified criteria. Normal organogenesis requires co-ordinate development and interaction of multiple cell types, and is seemingly governed by tissue specific factors. Lymphoid organogenesis during embryonic life is dependent on molecules the temporal expression of which is tightly regulated. A subset of these cells expresses the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, which is essential for mammalian enteric nervous system formation. Although a basic model of tissue formation has been developed through laboratory experimentation [#CITATION_TAG, [34] [35] [36], the reasons for this emergent behaviour are not fully understood.","During this process, haematopoietic 'inducer' cells interact with stromal 'organizer' cells, giving rise to the lymphoid organ primordia. Here we show that the haematopoietic cells in the gut exhibit a random pattern of motility before aggregation into the primordia of Peyer's patches, a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. To support this hypothesis, we show that the RET ligand ARTN is a strong attractant of gut haematopoietic cells, inducing the formation of ectopic Peyer's patch-like structures.","['Our work strongly suggests that the RET signalling pathway, by regulating the development of both the nervous and lymphoid system in the gut, has a key role in the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate intestine organogenesis.']"

This study sought to determine which depressive symptoms and medication side effects were perceived by patients with MDD to have the greatest interference on work functioning. Having a health problem is a strong determinant of sickness presenteeism (odds ratio = 3.32). For any given health status, there are certain other factors (personally and work-related demands) that impact on the risk of sickness presence, such as difficulties in staff replacement, time pressure, insufficient resources, and poor personal financial situation. However, the greater proportion of the total economic burden of MDD lies in reduced productivity, or presenteeism, in which the depressed individual remains in the work setting but with productivity suffering both in quality and quantity [#CITATION_TAG, 8].",Methods: The study group comprised a random sample of 3136 persons who responded to a questionnaire administered in conjunction with Statistics Sweden's labor market survey.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying pathogenesis remains poorly understood.

However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far.

490,"Understanding how children develop in this complex environment will require a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of how the child and environment interact-- both within and beyond the laboratory. Categories, like children, do not exist in isolation. Consequently, category learning cannot be easily separated from the learning context--nor should it be. According to a systems perspective of cognition and development, categorization emerges as the product of multiple factors combining in time (Thelen and Smith, 1994). To be as inclusive as possible, we consider any case in which a participant responds to how stimuli may be grouped as evidence of category learning. You may notice in these examples that we have not included children's ages because, according to a systems view, research should not be about age per se. Obviously, age must be taken into account in experimental design because age is generally (but not perfectly) correlated with developmental level (e.g., appropriate motor responses differ for a 2-year-old vs. 2-month-old). WHO IS INVOLVED IN LEARNING In the real world children learn through play and independent exploration (HirshPasek et al., 2009). However, in the lab children are seldom alone. This is important because children adjust their learning depending on who is providing information (e.g., the same or different experimenter, Goldenberg and Sandhofer, 2013; human or robot, O'Connell et al., 2009; mom or dad, Pancsofar and VernonFeagans, 2006). Children are also opportunistic and will look for any signal of what the right answer is. For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., Akhtar et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984). Moreover, who the child is also matters. WHAT IS BEING CATEGORIZED All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (Sloutsky, 2010). Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004; Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007). In naturalistic environments, categories are often ad hoc and flexible (Barsalou, 1983). For example, the category ""toys to pick up before bed"" may be discussed every day, but each day it may include different items. Furthermore, the process of categorizing objects is not independent of the objects themselves: different objects may be more or less flexibly assigned to www.frontiersin.org January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 1 different categories depending on the context (Mareschal and Tan, 2007) and information available (Horst et al., 2009). Where a child lives impacts what social categories they learn and the category choices they make. For example, Black Xhosa children in South Africa prefer own-race faces if they live in a primarily Black township, but prefer higher-status race faces if they live in a racially diverse city (Shutts et al., 2011). In the lab, location matters both in terms of where the child is and where the stimuli are. For example, children are more likely to learn names for non-solid substances if introduced to the gooey items in a familiar highchair context (Perry et al., 2014). For example, yes/no questions lead to a stronger shape bias than forced-choice questions (Samuelson et al., 2009), various types of feedback differentially affect learning categories with highly salient features vs. less salient features (Hammer et al., 2012) and highly variable category members facilitate category name generalization (Perry et al., 2010) whereas less variable category members facilitate category name retention (Twomey et al., 2014). Categorization does not reflect static knowledge; rather, category learning unfolds over time and is a product of nested timescales. Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (McMurray et al., 2012). That is, learning continues even on test trials--in fact, participants may not realize the shift from learning to test trials. Consequently, different behaviors are observed depending on when during the categorization process category learning is assessed (Horst et al., 2005). Category learning is a product of nested timescales including (a) the current moment (e.g., how similar the stimuli are on the current trial, Horst and Twomey, 2013), (b) the ""just previous"" past (e.g., what happens during the intertrial interval, Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007; whether stimuli on the first test trial are novel or familiar, Schoner and Thelen, 2006; and trial order effects Wilkinson et al., 2003; Vlach et al., 2008) and (c) developmental history (e.g., vocabulary level, Ellis and Oakes, 2006; Horst et al., 2009; Perry and Samuelson, 2011). Because children's behavior is never solely the product of a single timescale it is impossible to create an experiment that taps only into category learning in the moment or only knowledge children brought to the lab. For example, Kovack-Lesh et al. UNEXPECTED INFLUENCES If researchers view categorization as static knowledge, then neither the when or how should matter. Many researchers hold this view, which purports experiments are designed to test what a child knows upon arrival at the lab: trial order and trial types are largely trivial. Small variations in what children experience during category learning can have dramatic impact on how they form categories (e.g., sequential vs. simultaneous presentation, Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Lawson, 2014) and differences in testing contexts can lead to indications of what has been learned (Cohen and Marks, 2002). Subtle experimental design decisions, such as the number of test trials to include, may not seem theoretically significant, but they can have profound effects on children's behavior. As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (Axelsson and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Samuelson et al., 2007). For example, how broadly participants generalize a category label depends on where the exemplars are presented and if the exemplars are visible simultaneously (Spencer et al., 2011). In particular whether more or less diverse examples occur in the first block of trials influences later generalization (see Spencer et al., 2011, Supplementary Materials). Unexpected influences may not be of immediate theoretical interest to a given experimenter, but they are still often informative--even at times vital-- to the underlying processes at work (e.g., the influence of novelty on children's selection is informative for understanding how prior memory influences current learning). We recognize this can be impractical with populations that are costly to recruit, in which case such factors may Frontiers in Psychology | Cognition January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 2 be controlled for statistically, for example with item-level analyses. OUTLOOK Category learning unfolds across both space and time, and small differences at one moment (e.g., shared features among the stimuli; whether exemplars are identical) can create a ripple of effects on real behavior. Behavior emerges from the combination of many factors, including those not explicitly manipulated or controlled by the experimenter. However, just as it is important to acknowledge these unexpected influences, we must not fail to see the forest for the trees. If a behavior such as category learning can only be captured in an ideal environment under carefully-controlled conditions, how much can we generalize to the contexts in which learning typically occurs? Theoretical accounts that neglect the rich influence of context in real time are too narrow to be applied outside the lab (Simmering and Perone, 2013). What we as researchers are ultimately trying to understand is how learning occurs in a real, cluttered world across time and a variety of contexts. Consequently, a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of cognitive development will require understanding how the child (or adult) and environment interact. In this paper, we include many different types of behaviors under the umbrella term ""categorization."" Our goal is not to create a catalog of milestones; our goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms driving change. Our point, however, is that we will learn more about category learning if we stop asking questions such as ""how do prototype representations compare between 6 and 8 months of age?"" Thus, in order to understand the process of categorization, researchers must ensure that the results they find in the lab are not too closely tied to the specific stimuli. Thus, it is vital to acknowledge the impact of such unexpected influences if we want to understand how categorization unfolds over time. Although vocabulary acquisition requires children learn names for multiple things, many investigations of word learning mechanisms teach children the name for only one of the objects presented. This is problematic because it is unclear whether children's performance reflects recall of the correct name-object association or simply selection of the only object that was singled out by being the only object named. Children introduced to one novel name may perform at ceiling as they are not required to discriminate on the basis of the name per se, and appear to rapidly learn words following minimal exposure to a single word. As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (#CITATION_TAG) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007;. For example, how broadly participants generalize a category label depends on where the exemplars are presented and if the exemplars are visible simultaneously (Spencer et al., 2011).","We introduced children to four novel objects. For half the children, only one of the objects was named and for the other children, all four objects were named. Only children introduced to one word reliably selected the target object at test.",['This demonstration highlights the over-simplicity of one-word learning paradigms and the need for a shift in word learning paradigms where more than one word is taught to ensure children disambiguate objects on the basis of their names rather than their degree of salience']

312,"Major academic publishers need to be able to analyse their vast catalogue of products and select the best items to be marketed in scientific venues. This is a complex exercise that requires characterising with a high precision the topics of thousands of books and matching them with the interests of the relevant communities. In Springer Nature, this task has been traditionally handled manually by publishing editors. However, the rapid growth in the number of scientific publications and the dynamic nature of the Computer Science landscape has made this solution increasingly inefficient. We have addressed this issue by creating Smart Book Recommender (SBR), an ontologybased recommender system developed by The Open University (OU) in collaboration with Springer Nature, which supports their Computer Science editorial team in selecting the products to market at specific venues. Increasingly, organizations are adopting ontologies to describe their large catalogues of items. These ontologies need to evolve regularly in response to changes in the domain and the emergence of new requirements. This operation needs to take into account a variety of factors and in particular reconcile user requirements and application performance. This API supports a number of applications, including Smart Book Recommender, Smart Topic Miner [5], the Technology-Topic Framework [6], a system that forecasts the propagation of technologies across research communities, and the Pragmatic Ontology Evolution Framework [#CITATION_TAG], an approach to ontology evolution that is able to select new concepts on the basis of their contribution to specific computational tasks.","An important step of this process is the selection of candidate concepts to include in the new version of the ontology. Current ontology evolution methods focus either on ranking concepts according to their relevance or on preserving compatibility with existing applications. In this paper, we propose the Pragmatic Ontology Evolution (POE) framework, a novel approach for selecting from a group of candidates a set of concepts able to produce a new version of a given ontology that (i) is consistent with the a set of user requirements (e.g., max number of concepts in the ontology), (ii) is parametrised with respect to a number of dimensions (e.g., topological considerations), and (iii) effectively supports relevant computational tasks. Our approach also supports users in navigating the space of possible solutions by showing how certain choices, such as limiting the number of concepts or privileging trendy concepts rather than historical ones, would reflect on the application performance.","['However, they do not take in consideration the impact of the ontology evolution process on the performance of computational tasks - e.g., in this work we focus on instance tagging, similarity computation, generation of recommendations, and data clustering.']"

Rational models of cognition typically consider the abstract computational problems posed by the environment, assuming that people are capable of optimally solving those problems. DSM can further provide a means of accommodating growing power generation from fluctuating renewable sources (#CITATION_TAG) and may also help to address carbon emissions constraints (Bergaentzlé et al. 2014).","This differs from more traditional formal models of cognition, which focus on the psychological processes responsible for behavior. In particular, we argue that Monte Carlo methods provide a source of rational process models that connect optimal solutions to psychological processes. We support this argument through a detailed example, applying this approach to Anderson's (1990, 1991) rational model of categorization (RMC), which involves a particularly challenging computational problem. Drawing on a connection between the RMC and ideas from nonparametric Bayesian statistics, we propose 2 alternative algorithms for approximate inference in this model. The algorithms we consider include Gibbs sampling, a procedure appropriate when all stimuli are presented simultaneously, and particle filters, which sequentially approximate the posterior distribution with a small number of samples that are updated as new data become available.","['A basic challenge for rational models is thus explaining how optimal solutions can be approximated by psychological processes.', 'We outline a general strategy for answering this question, namely to explore the psychological plausibility of approximation algorithms developed in computer science and statistics.']"

Research on the determinants of waking thought content (Klinger, 1978) has demonstrated the influence of current concerns on cognitive processes. The concept of current concern refers to the state of an organism between the time it becomes committed to a particular goal and the consummation or abandonment of the goal. Responsiveness to external stimulation has been shown to occur in sleeping subjects. Subjects can be induced to perform physical acts in response to cues introduced while they are asleep (Evans, Gustafson, O'Connell, Orne, & Shor, 1970; Oswald, Taylor, & Treisman, 1960; Williams, Morlock, & Morlock, 1966). Both the cues and the responses used in these investigations varied considerably: stereotyped hand movements to taperecorded names (Oswald et al., 1960), overlearned natural responses to suggestions about subjects' physical states, such as scratching one's nose in response to the suggestion that it was itchy (Evans et al., 1970), or finger movements in response to conditioned auditory stimuli (Williams et al., 1966). One investigation in a sleep laboratory using standard electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement measures (#CITATION_TAG) administered a modified Concern Dimensions Questionnaire (CDQ; Klinger et al., 1980 Klinger et al.,, 1981 to assess seven participants' goals, followed by four consecutive nights, an adaptation night and three experimental nights, during which, five to seven times per night during Stage 1-rapid eye movement (REM) or Stage 2 sleep, the experimenters Hoelscher et al.

199,"The fungicides used to control diseases in cereal production can have adverse effects on non-target fungi, with possible consequences for plant health and productivity. The fungal community on wheat leaves consisted mainly of basidiomycete yeasts, saprotrophic ascomycetes and plant pathogens. This study examined fungicide effects on fungal communities on winter wheat leaves in two areas of Sweden. Seed is among the most key input for improving crop production and productivity. Increasing the quality of seeds can increase the yield potential of the crop by significant folds. In recent years seed has become an international commodity used to exchange germplasm around the world. Seed is, however, also an efficient means of introducing plant pathogens into a new area as well as providing a means of their survival from one cropping season to another. Seed borne mycroflora are significant destroyers of food stuffs and grains during storage rendering them unfit for human consumption by retarding their nutritive value and often by producing mycotoxins. Seed-borne pathogens have been involved in seed rots during germination and seedling mortality leading to poor crop stand reduction in plant growth and productivity of crops. The seed-borne pathogens associated with seeds externally or internally may cause seed abortion, seed rot, seed necrosis, reduction or elimination of germination capacity, as well as seedling damage resulting in development of disease at later stages of plant growth by systemic or local infection. Infected seeds play considerable role in the establishment of economically important plant diseases in the field resulting in heavy reduction of crop yields. The ascomycete A. pullulans is one of the most common inhabitants of the phyllosphere of many crops [48] and is also present in many other habitats [#CITATION_TAG].",It also discusses the detection mechanism and implies some management strategies that are implemented to reduce the loss due to seed borne fungi.,['This paper presents the negative impact of seed borne fungi and their implication in food safety.']
290,"As other authors have noted, as a concept, resilience involves some potentially serious conflicts or contradictions, for example between stability and dynamism, or between dynamic equilibrium (homeostasis) and evolution.

The debate on disaster resilience has continued to grow, albeit at a slow pace, since the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction held in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. One of the most important and striking aspects is that despite the conceptual differences, the resilience and vulnerability paradigms are still locked together and are increasingly being treated as if they are one and the same. The reason for this is not a difficult one. However, the notion of ""bounce back"" differentiates resilience from vulnerability. The ""bounce back"" notion is important to the extent that it liberates resilience from the vulnerability conundrum. Yet, the ""bounce back"" notion does not seem to acknowledge that disasters are accompanied by change. Three arguments are presented in this paper. It stems from resilire, resilio, Latin for ""bounce"" -hence the idea of ""bouncing back"" (#CITATION_TAG).","Resilience and vulnerability are viewed as opposite sides of the same coin (Twigg 2007). First, the ""bounce forward"" ability conceptualisation of resilience has implications on disaster research and scholarship.","['This paper posits that resilience should be viewed as the ability to ""bounce forward"" and ""move on"" following a disaster (Manyena 2009).', 'It helps us to re-think about the underlying philosophical arguments, particularly those around structure and agency.']"

732,"INTUITIVE AND REFLECTIVE RESPONSES IN PHILOSOPHY by NICK BYRD B.A. IRB protocol #13-0678 Nick Byrd (M.A., Philosophy) INTUITIVE AND REFLECTIVE REASONING IN PHILOSOPHY Committee: Michael Huemer, Robert Rupert, and Michael Tooley Cognitive scientists have revealed systematic errors in human reasoning. There is disagreement about what these errors indicate about human rationality, but one upshot seems clear: human reasoning does not seem to fit traditional views of human rationality. This concern about rationality has made its way through various fields and has recently caught the attention of philosophers. Nonetheless, philosophers are not entirely immune to this systematic error, and their proclivity for this error is statistically related to their responses to a variety of philosophical questions. So, while the evidence herein puts constraints on the worries about the integrity of philosophy, it by no means eliminates these worries. I also owe a great deal to various faculty members in cognitive science and psychology. The concern is that if philosophers are prone to systematic errors in reasoning, then the integrity of philosophy would be threatened. In this paper, I present some of the more famous work in cognitive science that has marshaled this concern. Do epistemic intuitions tell us anything about knowledge? Stich has argued that we respond to cases according to our contingent cultural programming, and not in a manner that tends to reveal anything significant about knowledge itself. I've argued that a cross-culturally universal capacity for mindreading produces the intuitive sense that the subject of a case has or lacks knowledge. I argue that existing work on cross-cultural variation in mindreading favors my position over Stich's Perhaps this is why philosophers will argue, explicitly or implicitly, that premises can be considered true or false in virtue of their intuitive appeal-viz., the premise just seems to be true or false (Audi 2004, Bealer 1998, Huemer 2005, #CITATION_TAG.",,"[""This paper responds to Stich's charge that mindreading is cross-culturally varied in a way that will strip epistemic intuitions of their evidential value.""]"
362,"Background Unassisted cessationquitting without pharmacological or professional supportis an enduring phenomenon. Unassisted cessation persists even in nations advanced in tobacco control where cessation assistance such as nicotine replacement therapy, the stop-smoking medications bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural assistance are readily available. We review the qualitative literature on the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted. Motivation, although widely reported, had only one clear meaning, that is 'the reason for quitting'. Commitment was equated to seriousness or resoluteness, was perceived as key to successful quitting, and was often used to distinguish earlier failed quit attempts from the final successful quit attempt. Commitment had different dimensions. BACKGROUND Telephone services can provide information and support for smokers. Counselling may be provided proactively or offered reactively to callers to smoking cessation helplines. Participants were mostly adult smokers from the general population, but some studies included teenagers, pregnant women, and people with long-term or mental health conditions. Most studies (100/104) assessed proactive telephone counselling, as opposed to reactive forms.Among trials including smokers who contacted helplines (32,484 participants), quit rates were higher for smokers receiving multiple sessions of proactive counselling (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.61; 14 trials, 32,484 participants; I2 = 72%) compared with a control condition providing self-help materials or brief counselling in a single call. There is currently insufficient evidence to assess potential variations in effect from differences in the number of contacts, type or timing of telephone counselling, or when telephone counselling is provided as an adjunct to other smoking cessation therapies. Yet, although these interventions are efficacious, [6] [#CITATION_TAG] [8] the majority of smokers who quit successfully do so without using them, choosing instead to quit unassisted, that is without pharmacological or professional support.","SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ICTRP for studies of telephone counselling, using search terms including 'hotlines' or 'quitline' or 'helpline'.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We pooled studies using a random-effects model and assessed statistical heterogeneity amongst subgroups of clinically comparable studies using the I2 statistic. In trials including smokers who did not call a quitline, we used meta-regression to investigate moderation of the effect of telephone counselling by the planned number of calls in the intervention, trial selection of participants that were motivated to quit, and the baseline support provided together with telephone counselling (either self-help only, brief face-to-face intervention, pharmacotherapy, or financial incentives).","['OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of telephone support to help smokers quit, including proactive or reactive counselling, or the provision of other information to smokers calling a helpline.']"

Word representation is a means of representing a word as mathematical entities that can be read, reasoned and manipulated by computational models. The representation is required for input to any new modern data models and in many cases, the accuracy of a model depends on it.

Abstract Background The number of days of pedometer or accelerometer data needed to reliably assess physical activity (PA) is important for research that examines the relationship with health. While this important research has been completed in young to middle-aged adults, data is lacking in older adults. When examining time spent in specific intensities of PA, fewer days of data are needed for accurate prediction of time spent in that activity for ActiGraph but more for the PA log. However, estimates of how many days of monitoring that should be included to obtain a reliable result vary considerably between studies [3-7, 2, 8], and might also vary between outcome variables of interest [6, #CITATION_TAG].","Methods Participants (52 older men and women; age = 69.3 +- 7.4 years, range= 55-86 years) wore a Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 pedometer and an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer while completing a PA log for 21 consecutive days.

1009,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Physicians who deny the existence of a transcendent power and hardly attend religious services are more likely to approve of euthanasia even in the case of minors or demented patients. This was not at all so in Belgium: An initial major motive for the introduction of palliative care was also to promote the acceptability of euthanasia (Bernheim 1990 (#CITATION_TAG Distelmans 2010).","Materials and Methods: An anonymous self administered questionnaire approved by Flemish Palliative Care Federation and its ethics steering group was sent to all physicians(n-147) working in Flemish Palliative Care.

In the world of environmental and technological controversies, however, many observers continue to call precisely for ""proof,"" often under the guise of ""scientific certainty."" Given that most scientific findings are inherently probabilistic and ambiguous, if agencies can be prevented from imposing any regulations until they are unambiguously ""justified,"" most regulations can be defeated or postponed, often for decades, allowing profitable but potentially risky activities to continue unabated. Many disciplines discuss skepticism, including politics (e.g., Taber & Lodge, 2006), philosophy (e.g., McGrath, 2011), sociology (e.g., #CITATION_TAG), and psychology (e.g., Lilienfeld, 2012).","An exploratory examination of previously documented controversies suggests that SCAMs are more widespread than has been recognized in the past, and that they deserve greater attention in the future. In the first section of the article, we draw on science and technology studies to underscore the point that science is often characterized not by certainty, but by uncertainty--meaning that the outcomes of scientific/technological controversies may depend less on which side has the ""best science"" than on which side enjoys the benefit of the doubt in the face of scientific ambiguity. In the second section, we note that the benefits of doubts may be distributed in ways that are not merely random: Although there is clearly a need for more extensive research, a series of riskrelated controversies, over a period of nearly a century, indicate that industrial interests have often managed to delay or prevent legislative and/or regulatory actions even in ""tough"" cases--those where the preponderance of scientific evidence had indicated significant reasons for concern.","['This article will identify a pattern of argument that is sufficiently common in regulatory debates that it appears to deserve its own name--""Scientific Certainty"" Argumentation Methods, or SCAMs.']"

834,"We consider approaches to explanation within the cognitive sciences that begin with Marr's computational level (e.g., purely Bayesian accounts of cognitive phenomena) or Marr's implementational level (e.g., reductionist accounts of cognitive phenomena based only on neural-level evidence) and argue that each is subject to fundamental limitations which impair their ability to provide adequate explanations of cognitive phenomena. For this reason, it is argued, explanation cannot proceed at either level without tight coupling to the algorithmic and representation level. Even at this level, however, we argue that additional constraints relating to the decomposition of the cognitive system into a set of interacting subfunctions (i.e., a cognitive architecture) are required. Integrated cognitive architectures that permit abstract specification of the functions of components and that make contact with the neural level provide a powerful bridge for linking the algorithmic and representational level to both the computational level and the implementational level.

639,"OPINION ARTICLE published: 16 April 2013 doi: 10.3389/fpls.2013.00099 Defining new SNARE functions: the i-SNARE Gian-Pietro Di Sansebastiano* Laboratory of Botany, DiSTeBA, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy *Correspondence: gp.disansebastiano@unisalento.it Edited by: Markus Geisler, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Reviewed by: Markus Geisler, University of Fribourg, Switzerland Frantisek Baluska, University of Bonn, Germany Giovanni Stefano, Michigan State University, USA SNAREs (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor adaptor protein receptors) have been often seen to have a dishomogeneous distribution on membranes and are apparently present in excess of the amount required to assure correct vesicle traffic. It was also shown in few cases that SNARE on the target membrane (t-SNARE) with a fusogenic role, can become non-fusogenic when overexpressed. SNARE ABUNDANCE AND INFLUENCE OF DISTRIBUTION ON THEIR FUSOGENIC ROLE SNAREs are relatively small polypeptides (~200-400-amino-acids) characterized by the presence of a particular domain, the SNARE motif (Jahn and Scheller, 2006), consisting of heptad repeats that can form a coiled-coil structure. Via heterooligomeric interactions, these proteins form highly stable protein-protein interactions organized in a SNARE-complex that help to overcome the energy barrier required for membrane fusion. Even after considering all these potential interactors, in living cells, most SNARE molecules are apparently present in excess and concentrated in clusters, thus constituting a spare pool not readily available for interactions. About the alteration of SNARE function, it is essential to remember that antibodies or recombinant SNARE fragments, showing inhibitory or dominant negative (DN) effect, for example, on syntaxin 13 (Bethani et al., 2009), induce effects that are very different: antibodies cause the depletion of active domains while SNARE fragments cause the competitive saturation of the interacting partners. SNAREs (precisely t-SNAREs) have been visualized to form apparent clusters using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. This inhomogeneous distribution was initially proposed to provide a localized pool of t-SNAREs to facilitate and enhance membranes fusion (van den Bogaart et al., 2011) but recently, using super-resolution microscopy techniques, Yang and coworkers (2012) showed that secretory vesicles were preferentially targeted to membrane areas with a low density of SNAREs. Vesicles do not preferentially target these microdomains. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain protein clustering in micro-domains and the t-SNARE distribution seems to depend both on lipidic and proteic contributions (Yang et al., 2012). Regulating t-SNARE distribution the cell could dynamically modulate vesicle fusion probabilities and consequently the kinetics of the cellular response (Silva et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). Recently we observed for Arabidopsis SYP51 and SYP52 a double localization associated to two different functions (De Benedictis et al., 2012). Also in Petunia hybrida, the single SYP51 gene cloned up to now (Faraco, 2011) seems to define in petal epidermal cells a very well defined vacuolar compartments separated from www.frontiersin.org April 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 99 | 1 the central vacuole and already observed with other vacuolar markers (Verweij et al., 2008). The discovery of new structural roles for SNAREs, eventually related to the interaction with still unknown partners, may shed light on vacuolar complex organization and it is not surprising that results about vacuolar SNAREs still appear contradictory. Bethani and co-workers (2009) discussed interesting points proving SNARE specificity. Little attention is generally paid to the need of the cell to keep very similar compartments separated, because this need may not be evident among endosomes as much as among larger vacuolar structures typical of only few plant cells (Epimashko et al., 2004; Verweij et al., 2008). Proteolipidic composition appears determinant (Strasser et al., 2011). From new data about vacuolar fusion in yeast, it seems that different SNAREs actively bind to different V-ATPase subunits, influencing their interaction with the proteolipid cylinder so promoting, or inhibiting, the lipid reorientation for the formation of a lipidic fusion pore (Strasser et al., 2011). It is extremely interesting a recent report on SNAREs interaction with proteolipid (Di Giovanni et al., 2010). It was suggested that this interaction had the effect to concentrate SNAREs in some areas to enhance their fusogenic potential but it is now evident that more regulatory events than simple localization is involved. i-SNAREs At the moment, in plants, it was observed that SYP21 (Foresti et al., 2006), SYP51, and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) inhibit vacuolar traffic when overexpressed. Varlamov and co-workers (2004) suggested that non-fusogenic SNARE complexes, including the i-SNARE partners, have the physiological function at the level of the Golgi apparatus to increase the polarity of this organelle. Mammalian and yeast i-SNAREs (syntaxin 6/Tlg1, GS15/Sft1, and rBet1/Bet1) were found functionally conserved but i-SNARE characterization in plants is still poor. A mechanism for the i-SNARE effect of yeast Qc-SNAREs is described by the competition between endosomal (Tlg1 and Syn8) and vacuolar form (Vam7) of the proteins (Izawa et al., 2012) and because of their ability to interact with V-ATPase subunits influencing membrane potential (Strasser et al., 2011). More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (Grefen et al., 2010). The speculations about the mechanism active in plant cells can include the mechanisms elucidated in yeast cells with the exception that in S. cerevisiae a single Qc-SNARE is active at each step but more than one are active in plants. Several sorting processes may be influenced by the higher concentration of specific SNAREs but the phenomena are simply not yet correlated. SNAREs can also be specifically localized and active as t-SNARE on intermediate compartments, such as for example SYP61, localized on the TGN membranes (2). The compartments indicated in the figure are generic; their identity may change in different experimental systems and in differentiated cells. pollen tubes (Wang et al., 2011) where SYP5s are expressed at higher levels than in all other tissues (Lipka et al., 2007; De Benedictis et al., 2012). The equilibrium between fusogenic (tSNARE) and non fusogenic (i-SNARE) activity of specific SNAREs may reside on their localization, as highlighted for SYP51 and SYP52 (De Benedictis et al., 2012) but also on the formation of ""clusters"" in cholesterol-containing microdomains (Sieber et al., 2006, 2007). In this manuscript I discuss data obtained in various eukaryotic models that leave open different possibilities for the action mechanism of the i-SNAREs in plants. It supported the idea that a small number of SNAREs is needed to drive a single fusion event and that the proteins not engaged in classic fusion events are maintained, by yet undefined mechanisms, in membrane micro-domains with a non-random molecular composition. These have been proposed to belong to a new functional class of SNAREs (Varlamov et al., 2004). The SNARE protein of Arabidopsis, SYP121, contributes to vesicle traffic and also controls the gating of K+ channels for K+ uptake by binding to the KC1 channel subunit. The SNARE (for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor protein attachment protein receptor) protein SYP121 (=SYR1/PEN1) of Arabidopsis thaliana facilitates vesicle traffic, delivering ion channels and other cargo to the plasma membrane, and contributing to plant cell expansion and defense. More proteins potentially able to interact with SNAREs can have a direct influence on membrane potential such as ion channels, as shown in the case of SYP121, able to interact and control the K(+) channel KC1 (#CITATION_TAG).","Here, we report isolating a minimal sequence motif of SYP121 prerequisite for its interaction with KC1. We made use of yeast mating-based split-ubiquitin and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays for protein-protein interaction and of expression and electrophysiological analysis.","['The identity of the KC1 binding site on the SNARE protein, described in this study, points to a novel role for the channel subunit in coordinating vesicle traffic.']"

They owe their brightness to the dense confined plasma, and this review focuses on loops mostly as structures confining plasma. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered and, therefore, topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones, which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with separate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. Widespread evidence for outward propagation of Alfvén waves is reported from ground optical polarimetric observations (#CITATION_TAG), and non-thermal broadening has been shown to correlate with swaying motions detected in the corona from SDO/AIA data (speed of ∼ 20 km s -1 and periods of few minutes) (McIntosh et al., 2011).","Treatment of DC with intact IgG or Fab of mAb DF272 enhanced their T cell stimulatory capacity.

842,"We consider approaches to explanation within the cognitive sciences that begin with Marr's computational level (e.g., purely Bayesian accounts of cognitive phenomena) or Marr's implementational level (e.g., reductionist accounts of cognitive phenomena based only on neural-level evidence) and argue that each is subject to fundamental limitations which impair their ability to provide adequate explanations of cognitive phenomena. For this reason, it is argued, explanation cannot proceed at either level without tight coupling to the algorithmic and representation level. Even at this level, however, we argue that additional constraints relating to the decomposition of the cognitive system into a set of interacting subfunctions (i.e., a cognitive architecture) are required. Integrated cognitive architectures that permit abstract specification of the functions of components and that make contact with the neural level provide a powerful bridge for linking the algorithmic and representational level to both the computational level and the implementational level. Background Epidemiological research has shown that hallucinations and delusions, the classic symptoms of psychosis, are far more prevalent in the population than actual psychotic disorder. These symptoms are especially prevalent in childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal research has demonstrated that psychotic symptoms in adolescence increase the risk of psychotic disorder in adulthood. There has been a lack of research, however, on the immediate clinicopathological significance of psychotic symptoms in adolescence. Adolescents who reported psychotic symptoms were at particularly high risk of having multiple co-occurring diagnoses. Conclusions Psychotic symptoms are important risk markers for a wide range of non-psychotic psychopathological disorders, in particular for severe psychopathology characterised by multiple co-occurring diagnoses. This has resulted in recent demonstrations that the importance sampling algorithm can be implemented by exemplar-based memory mechanisms (#CITATION_TAG; Shi & Griffiths, 2009; Shi et al., 2010).",Method Data from four population studies were used: two early adolescence studies (ages 11-13 years) and two mid-adolescence studies (ages 13-16 years).

Studies 3 and 4 involved in-depth diagnostic interview assessments of psychotic symptoms and lifetime psychiatric disorders in community samples of 423 children aged 11-15 years. These symptoms should be carefully assessed in all patients.,"['Aims To investigate the relationship between psychotic symptoms and non-psychotic psychopathology in community samples of adolescents in terms of prevalence, co-occurring disorders, comorbid (multiple) psychopathology and variation across early v. middle adolescence.']"
602,"We studied choreographer Wayne McGregor's approach to movement creation through tasking, in which he asks dancers to create movement in response to task instructions that require a great deal of mental imagery and decision making. As part of a programme of research that is developing tools to enhance choreographic practice, an interdisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and dance professionals collaborated on two studies examining the mental representations used to support movement creation. Creativity has long been a construct of interest to philosophers, psychologists and, more recently, neuroscientists. Recent efforts have focused on cognitive processes likely to be important to the manifestation of novelty and usefulness within a given social context. One such cognitive process - divergent thinking - is the process by which one extrapolates many possible answers to an initial stimulus or target data set. The distribution of brain regions, associated with both divergent thinking and creative achievement, suggests that cognitive control of information flow among brain areas may be critical to understanding creative cognition. Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (#CITATION_TAG), especially in music (Limb and Braun, 2008) and drawing (Bhattacharya & Petsche, 2005).","Three independent judges ranked the creative products of each subject using the consensual assessment technique (Amabile, 1982) from which a ""composite creativity index"" (CCI) was derived.

It is assumed that the detection of CTCs is associated with cancer, based on the finding that CTCs can be detected in all major cancer and not in healthy subjects or those with benign disease. Patients with chronic prostatitis may have circulating prostate cells detected in blood, which do not express the enzyme P504S and should be thought of as benign in nature.

In the ""stagnationist"" macroeconomics, the long-term problem of growth and distribution has been discussed in a short-period Kaleckian framework which abstracts from labor market-output market interaction to determine real wages. However, even in this framework, one can challenge the stagnationist conclusion that there is no trade-off between wage and profit and between distribution and growth. Evidently, in a general framework, there is no unambiguous relationship between distribution and growth. Thus, stability is a prerequisite for change (Lundgren, 1992) and an inherent feature of a network (#CITATION_TAG).",So distributive justice should be taken as a separate objective on its own merit.,"['One way of doing this is to bring in the role of foreign price competition.', 'Another way is to allow the possibility of saving out of wage income in a closed ""stagnationist"" framework presented here.']"

Recent research in multivoxel pattern-based fMRI analysis has led to considerable success at decoding within individual subjects. However, the goal of being able to decode across subjects is still challenging: It has remained unclear what population-level regularities of neural representation there might be. On the contrary, to decode across subjects, it is beneficial to abstract away from subject-specific patterns of neural activity and, instead, to operate on the similarity relations between those patterns: Our new approach performs decoding purely within similarity space.

786,"Design and Implementation of Pay for Performance * A large, mature and robust economic literature on pay for performance now exists, which provides a useful framework for thinking about pay for performance systems. Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called ""bias""). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. An interesting implication of distortion and manipulability is that numeric performance measures may degrade over time (Courty & Marschke 2004, #CITATION_TAG.","In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.",['Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text.']
848,"Choices are not only communicated via explicit actions but also passively through inaction. Additionally, the choice itself was biased towards action such that subjects tended to choose a photograph obtained by action more often than a photographed obtained through inaction. In this study we investigated how active or passive choice impacts upon the choice process itself as well as a preference change induced by choice. Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. One paradigm demonstrating how choice affects preferences is the free-choice paradigm wherein value judgements are gathered on options before and after subjects are forced to choose one and reject the other option [#CITATION_TAG, 7].","After making a choice between two objects, people evaluate their chosen item higher and their rejected item lower (i.e., they ""spread "" the alternatives). Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences, and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first, by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold, and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading.","[""In this paper, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged.""]"

459,"The contents and recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the Economic Research Forum. In the last few decades, the world has witnessed an enormous growth in the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI). The global stock of FDI reached US$ 7.5 trillion in 2003 and accounted for 11% of world Gross Domestic Product, up from 7% in 1990. Substantial FDI inflows went into transition countries. Inflows into one of the region's largest recipient, the Russian Federation, almost doubled, enabling Russia to become one of the five top FDI destinations in 2005-2006. FDI inflows in Russia have increased almost threefold from 13.6% in 2003 to 35% in 2007. In 2003, these flows were twice greater than those into China; whilst in 2007 they were six times larger. Efficient government institutions are argued by many economists to foster FDI and growth as a result. However, the magnitude of this effect has yet to be measured. This casts some doubt on the productivity of the investment in public capital in these regions as it might be that bureaucrats may prefer to use these infrastructural projects for rent extraction.

This article argues that, due to changes in the broader institutional environment, the engagement-values relation is likely to generally lack temporal stability. Most quantitative research in social capital focuses on civic engagement in formal organisations. Data on social capital in informal social networks are harder to obtain and there has also been insufficient means for investigating this. Informal social networks, especially having good neighbourly relations, tend to foster greater trust than does formal civic engagement.

181,"Humans and the institutions they devise for their governance are often successful at self-organizing to promote their survival in the face of virtually any environment challenge. However, from history we learn that there may often be unanticipated costs to many of these solutions with long-term implications on future societies. For example, increased specialization has led to increased surplus of food and made continuing In this chapter, we explore the historical dimension of urbanization and why the ecology of urbanization has, until recently, been missing. Constantinople is a city whose origin can be traced back to the establishment of Greek cities and colonies in early antiquity. Eventually it became the capital of the East Roman Empire, and since then its major role in the region has not diminished, whether under the rule of Byzantine emperors or Ottoman sultans. For more than 2000 years the city and its inhabitants have endured numerous changes and crises. Plague, war and economic regression have at times reduced its population to only a fraction of the previous size. The city has been subject to numerous sieges, the longest lasting eight years! Conquered only once prior to the major transformation in 1453, the city flourished again after each crisis and today it is still an important centre in this part of the world, on the border between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. How could Constantinople maintain its leading position for such a long time, after suffering so many crises? The authors explore how the inhabitants of the ancient city of Constantinople managed to maintain a resilient food supply system. Constantinople differs in many ways from our modern cities, which are dependent on resources from a global hinterland that are transported using fossil fuels, and thus it can serve as an educational example for our time. At its first peak during the 6th century it was dependent on a complex grain transport system with ships travelling all the way to North Africa. This system collapsed in conjunction with the Arab expansion in the 7th century, and the collapse became a major part of a long recession that profoundly affected the city. That the city nonetheless survived cannot be explained by any single factor. A particularly interesting aspect, related to today's global transport system, is the urban agriculture system within and just outside the city walls. In our society, where the supply of food is considered as something obvious, one can question whether we lack memory as well as preparations for similar crises despite the fact that the food supply crisis of the Second World War is only 65 years behind us.Urban mind The most diffi cult blockade on the food supply lines, at the end of the fourteenth century AD, lasted an astonishing 8 years, but it did not succeed in starving out the urban population (#CITATION_TAG).","They rather delimited an area with dispersed ""sub-communities"" and numerous acres of, for example, orchards and vineyards.

Implicit learning is an inductive process whereby knowledge of a complex environment is acquired and used largely independently of awareness of either the process of acquisition or the nature of that which has been learned. The associationist about intuition will start by outlining a fairly well accepted tenet of cognitive science: whether or not we are aware of it, we are more or less constantly learning associations between things and properties of things via experience-e.g., if we frequently experience two things or properties of things together, then we will begin to associate them (Reber 1989, #CITATION_TAG, Talbot 2009.","Characterized this way, implicit learning theory can be viewed as an attempt to come to grips with the classic epistemological issues of knowledge acquisition, representation and use. The argument is made that the process, despite its seeming cognitive sophistication, is of considerable evolutionary antiquity and that it antedates awareness and the capacity for conscious control of mentation. Various classic heuristics from evolutionary biology are used to substantiate this claim and several specific entailments of this line of argument are outlined.",['Abstract This paper is an attempt to put the work of the past several decades on the problems of implicit learning and unconscious cognition into an evolutionary context.']

Overinflated claims of gender differences carry substantial costs in areas such as the workplace and relationships. These results, as well as the results herein, corroborate the gender similarities hypothesis: ""most psychological gender differences are in the close-to-zero (d ≤ 0.10) or small (0.11 < d < 0.35) range, a few are in the moderate range (0.36 < d < 0.65), and very few are large (d < 0.66-1.00) or very large (d < 1.00)"" (#CITATION_TAG).",,"['Here, the author advances a very different view, the gender similarities hypothesis, which holds that males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables.']"

114,"Research linking civic engagement to citizens' democratic values, generalized trust, cooperative norms, and so on often implicitly assumes such connections are stable over time. This article argues that, due to changes in the broader institutional environment, the engagement-values relation is likely to generally lack temporal stability. Mismatches between institutions and social problems trigger reforms, but do not determine the options that policy makers finally choose. Frictions caused by emerging social risks interact with difficulties of established welfare regimes to cope with old risks to facilitate access to public agendas for reformist projects. Ultimately, however, reforms depend on the construction of pro-and anti-reform coalitions, shaped by two main forces: 1) lines of discrimination in the distribution of benefits by existing welfare regimes; 2) strategies of parties, interest groups, and bureaucracies, competing to activate those cleavages according to their interests. Selective pay-offs to appease privileged groups constitute the most direct determinants of the architecture of reforms. However, exogenous shocks may facilitate changes away from expected paths. Based on the idea that institutions get 'locked in' as a result of self-reinforcement, self-reproduction and path dependence (e.g., #CITATION_TAG; Mahoney, 2000; Pierson, 2000), institutions have long been viewed as stable and resistant to change until 'exogenous shocks (...) bring about radical institutional reconfigurations' (Mahoney & Thelen, 2010, p. 2).","It theorizes the reforms by comparing pensions, health care, and social assistance policies. First, it provides an explanation of recent transformations of welfare regimes as resulting from the combined effects of gradual institutional change and exogenous socioeconomic transformations. Second, it explores the potentialities and limitations of historical institutionalism. Third, it identifies emerging patterns of governance. This requires combining strategies of blame-avoidance and credit-claiming that variably mix persuasion, exclusion, and division targeting potential opposition.

618,"In cognitive archeology, theories of cognition are used to guide interpretation of archeological evidence. But the implications that archeology has for cognitive science particularly relate to traditional proposals from the field involving modular decomposition, symbolic thought and the mediating role of language. There is a need to make a connection with more recent approaches, which more strongly emphasize information, probabilistic reasoning and exploitation of embodiment. Proposals from cognitive archeology, in which evolution of cognition is seen to involve a transition to symbolic thought need to be realigned with theories from cognitive science that no longer give symbolic reasoning a central role. The present paper develops an informational approach, in which the transition is understood to involve cumulative development of information-rich generalizations. Wheeler's argument draws on analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, and empirical work to ""reconstruct"" the philosophical foundations of cognitive science in a time of a fundamental shift away from a generically Cartesian approach. Indeed, they are often seen to be philosophically flawed (#CITATION_TAG).","Wheeler begins with an interpretation of Descartes. He defines Cartesian psychology as a conceptual framework of explanatory principles and shows how each of these principles is part of the deep assumptions of orthodox cognitive science (both classical and connectionist). Wheeler then turns to Heidegger's radically non-Cartesian account of everyday cognition, which, he argues, can be used to articulate the philosophical foundations of a genuinely non-Cartesian cognitive science.","['In Reconstructing the Cognitive World, Michael Wheeler argues that we should turn away from the generically Cartesian philosophical foundations of much contemporary cognitive science research and proposes instead a Heideggerian approach.', 'He points to recent research in ""embodied-embedded"" cognitive science and proposes a Heideggerian framework to identify, amplify, and clarify the underlying philosophical foundations of this new work.', 'He focuses much of his investigation on recent work in artificial intelligence-oriented robotics, discussing, among other topics, the nature and status of representational explanation, and whether (and to what extent) cognition is computation rather than a noncomputational phenomenon best described in the language of dynamical systems theory.']"
759,"Despite the established importance of buyer-seller relationships in B-to-B markets, research to determine the differential effects that keep suppliers and customers in a relationship has been scarce. Only with regard to relational tolerance and only for buyers do switching costs play a greater role than relationship value. Referring to transaction cost analysis, this study investigates how switching costs and relationship value as perceived by each side unfold their bonding forces in such a relationship. Extant literature and suppliers interviewed for this study view a solution as a customized and integrated combination of goods and services for meeting a customer's business needs. In contrast, customers view a solution as a set of customer-supplier relational processes comprising (1) customer requirements definition, (2) customization and integration of goods and/or services and (3) their deployment, and (4) postdeployment customer support, all of which are aimed at meeting customers ' business needs. The relational process view can help suppliers deliver more effective solutions at profitable prices.

787,"Design and Implementation of Pay for Performance * A large, mature and robust economic literature on pay for performance now exists, which provides a useful framework for thinking about pay for performance systems. Objective measures of performance are seldom perfect. In response, incentive contracts often include important subjective components that mitigate incentive distortions caused by imperfect objective measures. Naturally, objective and subjective measures often are substitutes, sometimes strikingly so: we show that if objective measures are sufficiently close to perfect then no implicit contracts are feasible (because the firm's fallback position after reneging on an implicit contact is too attractive). Finally, subjective evaluations have their own form of uncontrollable risk for the employee: they are difficult to verify and enforce contractually, so they require relational contracting and adequate trust of the supervisor (#CITATION_TAG).",,['This paper explores the combined use of subjective and objective performance measures in (respectively) implicit and explicit incentive contracts.']

In this paper we address the question of identifying data elements in an unsupervised manner.

This problem is a key model in nonlinear optical physics and has increasingly important applications in the telecommunications industry.

To achieve this, the authors have extended the reach of two powerful analytical techniques that have arisen through the asymptotic analysis of integrable systems: the Lax-Levermore-Venakides variational approach to singular limits in integrable systems, and Deift and Zhou's nonlinear Steepest-Descent/Stationary Phase method for the analysis of Riemann-Hilbert problems. In particular, they introduce a systematic procedure for handling certain Riemann-Hilbert problems with poles accumulating on curves in the plane.","['In doing so they also aim to explain the observed gradient catastrophe for the underlying nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations, and to set forth a detailed, pointwise asymptotic description of the violent oscillations that emerge following the gradient catastrophe.', 'This book, which includes an appendix on the use of the Fredholm theory for Riemann-Hilbert problems in the Holder class, is intended for researchers and graduate students of applied mathematics and analysis, especially those with an interest in integrable systems, nonlinear waves, or complex analysis.']"

991,"Lung macrophages are an important defence against respiratory viral infection and recent work has demonstrated that influenza-induced macrophage PDL1 expression in the murine lung leads to rapid modulation of CD8+ T cell responses via the PD1 receptor. Viral infection significantly increased cell surface expression of PDL1 on explant macrophages, lung macrophages and MDM but not explant epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of PDL1 regulation by human macrophages in response to viral infection. The airway epithelium forms a continuous barrier from the nose to the alveoli and serves a variety of functions. Multiple functionally distinct cell types are involved in these processes. The innate defence functions require a patent airway epithelium, with infections often associated with epithelial defects and phenotypic alterations that are themselves associated with multiple lung diseases. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are frequently identified in the airways in a range of respiratory diseases These pathogens often trigger exacerbations and worsening symptoms that often result in hospitalisation. This is particularly true in paediatric populations. Although mortality for NTHi and RSV infections alone are themselves low it remains unclear what role these infections play in mortality rates in complex chronic respiratory infections. These markers are representative of different epithelial cell types within the cultures. Macrophages are not only a key line of defence in the respiratory tract, responsible for phagocytosis and clearance of infectious organisms but are also orchestrators of the adaptive immune response through presentation of antigen and by the cytokines they release [4, #CITATION_TAG].","In vitro airway models were established using lung derived cell lines, undifferentiated primary human bronchial epithelial (uHBE) cells and air-liquid interface (ALI) differentiated uHBE cell cultures. Following establishment of differentiation we validated ALI cultures using a number of markers, including for the putative innate defence PLUNC family proteins, gel-forming mucins and tubulin. Cultures were infected with NTHi or RSV for periods of time ranging from 1 hour to 7 days with a view to establishing chronic infections and allowing biofilm formation. Neutrophil products and trypsin were shown to degrade PLUNC proteins in ALI cell secretions.","['These studies aimed to establish NTHi and RSV infections within airway epithelium models, and use them as tools to study pulmonary innate defence mechanisms in order to understand the role of these infections in respiratory disease.']"
1028,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Following the 2002 enactment of the Belgian law on euthanasia, which requires the consultation of an independent second physician before proceeding with euthanasia, the Life End Information Forum (LEIF) was founded which provides specifically trained physicians who can act as mandatory consultants in euthanasia requests. They tended to more often discuss the request with the attending physician (100% vs 95%) and with the family (76% vs 69%), and also more frequently helped the attending physician with performing euthanasia (44% vs 24%). Irrespective of whether euthanasia is a legal practice within a country, similar services may prove useful to also improve quality of consultations in various other difficult end-of-life decision-making situations. The value of specific training for the quality of second physician consultation was recently documented (#CITATION_TAG).","This study assesses quality of consultations in Flanders and Brussels and compares these between LEIF and non-LEIF consultants.A questionnaire was sent in 2009 to a random sample of 3,006 physicians in Belgium from specialties likely involved in the care of dying patients.

1181,"According to transaction cost and internalization theories of multinational enterprises, companies make foreign direct investments (FDI) when the combined costs of operations and governance are lower for FDI than for market or contract based options, such as exports and licensing. Yet, ex post governance costs remain a conjectural construct, which has evaded empirical scrutiny, and the lack of focus on the implications of these costs constitutes a challenge for management in multinational companies (MNCs). What effects does the ensuing establishment of subsidiaries abroad have in terms of governance costs? What factors drive these costs? OBJECTIVES Patient safety has received increased attention in recent years, but mostly with a focus on the epidemiology of errors and adverse events, rather than on practices that reduce such events. The practices focused primarily on hospitalized patients, but some involved nursing home or ambulatory patients. For most practices, the project team required that the primary outcome consist of a clinical endpoint (i.e., some measure of morbidity or mortality) or a surrogate outcome with a clear connection to patient morbidity or mortality. Many patient safety practices drawn primarily from nonmedical fields (e.g., use of simulators, bar coding, computerized physician order entry, crew resource management) deserve additional research to elucidate their value in the health care environment. Such practices target a diverse array of safety problems. Within the empirical setting of this study, these costs occur inexorably out of intra-organizational coordination, but the same categories are also valid for inter-organizational coordination (#CITATION_TAG).","SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA Patient safety practices were defined as those that reduce the risk of adverse events related to exposure to medical care across a range of diagnoses or conditions. Potential patient safety practices were identified based on preliminary surveys of the literature and expert consultation. Protocols specified the inclusion criteria for studies and the structure for evaluation of the evidence regarding each practice. Pertinent studies were identified using various bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ABI/INFORM, INSPEC), targeted searches of the Internet, and communication with relevant experts. This criterion was relaxed for some practices drawn from the non-health care literature. The evidence supporting each practice was summarized using a prospectively determined format. The project team then used a predefined consensus technique to rank the practices according to the strength of evidence presented in practice summaries. A separate ranking was developed for research priorities. Appropriate use of prophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism in patients at risk; Use of perioperative beta-blockers in appropriate patients to prevent perioperative morbidity and mortality; Use of maximum sterile barriers while placing central intravenous catheters to prevent infections; Appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical patients to prevent postoperative infections; Asking that patients recall and restate what they have been told during the informed consent process; Continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (CASS) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia; Use of pressure relieving bedding materials to prevent pressure ulcers; Use of real-time ultrasound guidance during central line insertion to prevent complications; Patient self-management for warfarin (Coumadin) to achieve appropriate outpatient anticoagulation and prevent complications; Appropriate provision of nutrition, with a particular emphasis on early enteral nutrition in critically ill and surgical patients; and Use of antibiotic-impregnated central venous catheters to prevent catheter-related infections.",['This project aimed to collect and critically review the existing evidence on practices relevant to improving patient safety.']
585,"Dinitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria is of particular importance for the nutrient economy of cold biomes, constituting the main pathway for new N supplies to tundra ecosystems. It is prevalent in cyanobacterial colonies on bryophytes and in obligate associations within cyanolichens. Recent studies, ap-plying interspecific variation in plant functional traits to upscale species effects on ecosystems, have all but neglected cryptogams and their association with cyanobacteria. Cyanolichens and bryophytes differed significantly in their cyanobacterial N fixation capacity, which was not driven by microhabitat characteristics, but rather by morphology and physiology. Cyanolichens were much more prominent fixers than bryophytes per unit dry weight, but not per unit area due to their low specific thallus weight. There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function (into 'functional types') rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes (e.g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes.

The present paper develops an informational approach, in which the transition is understood to involve cumulative development of information-rich generalizations. Almost all the reviewers of Margaret Boden's Mind as machine have noted the obvious: at 2 volumes, 1452 pages, 134 pages of references, and seemingly infinite parenthetically cross-references, this book, longer than most editions of War and peace, is impractical, unwieldy, and inaccessible to readers. Boden did not intend Mind as machine to be a pleasant read for a weekend's leisure. Yet, according to her, this analogy, as well as its parallel ""mind as machine"", is of recent origin. It was only by the close of the nineteenth century that mechanistic theories of mind acquired respectability. These theories, however, were mere analogies; no one seriously contemplated consilience between the behaviours of machines and men. Still less did anyone outside science fiction circles propose that machines could be intelligent in the same way as humans. By the mid-1800s, Charles Babbage had invented an analytical engine, somewhat akin to a programme-controlled digital computer, but he never claimed it to have implications for psychology or biology, though perhaps his student Ada Lovelace hinted at the possibility. Thus, it was during the war years of the 1940s, at the height of collaborations between Anglo-American scientists, that computers began being developed, and with them, some investigators, such as Alan Turing, began to study questions about machine intelligence. In the 1950s, these claims led to the emergence of the multi-disciplinary field of the cognitive sciences, a discipline well provided for by philanthropic and institutional sources of support, stocked with new venues for publication, and bolstered by artificial intelligence research paradigms. It was, none the less, a field riddled with intellectual divides, which developed over the next half century. Behaviourism, then predominant, was on the wane. Seen as too universalist, it was criticized by Gestaltists, linguists, ethologists, proto-connectionists, anthropologists, and Noam Chomsky alike (the last comes bizarrely in Boden's narrative with a ""health warning"", p. 591). In this ferment, the ""mind as machine"" debate took different paths: cyberneticists, for example, assumed that the mind as a machine was identical with the body. Computational psychologists--little more than a smattering of research endeavours--treated the human mind as different from its body, and concerned themselves with questions about how the mind was different. The majority of psychologists, however, focused on what made the mind different. Always lurking in the background was the question of whether human thought was ""constituted by, or identical with"" symbolic processes (p. 702). Those questions especially plagued papers and programmes on artificial intelligence--even when their authors were uninterested in the answers. Artificial intelligence research bolstered this nascent field enormously during the last half of the century. AI research, however, was perhaps more tied to the geopolitical context of the Cold War period and the neo-Liberal period of the 1980s and 1990s than the cognitive sciences. While much AI work focused on developing programming languages and had modest goals (seek general intelligence but not human-like intelligence, appeared almost as an injunction), critics levelled numerous charges at AI-workers, despite the fact that few were seeking to understand the human mind as a machine. Seymour Papert, an early pioneer, for instance, used only simple programmes to understand thinking processes. Yet, as defence spending increased, AI's proponents and detractors became uncomfortable with the glib assertions being promulgated within policy and media exaggerations, especially the belief that enormous computer systems controlling weapon systems could be ""bug"" free in their script, and commonsensical in their behaviour. Connectionists, a new but inchoate group of psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers of the mind, also tore into the AI project. They argued that phenomena were represented within emerging networks (usually neurological) and not symbolic systems, which many within old-fashioned AI paradigms had claimed. In hindsight, all of AI's failed promises and faulty philosophical assumptions have led some to pronounce it a failed research programme. She observes that AI enormously advanced both itself and the cognitive sciences. In that sense, and contrary to its critics, AI continued as a fruitful area of research, but like its latest corollaries, computational neuroscience and artificial life, the field remains embryonic even today. Having read those chapters alongside M R Bennett and P M S Hacker's excellent Philosophical foundations of the neurosciences (2003), I find myself having misgivings about the conceptual foundations of much of the cognitive sciences project as outlined by Boden. In any case, Boden's volumes, despite their evident value, will aggravate many. Historians studying periods before 1945 will find fault both with her facts and pithy generalizations. Similarly, those still living cognitive scientists whose careers spanned 1945 and 2000 are bound not to recognize the caricatures of themselves, or people they knew, in her story. Such criticisms, which have already begun circulating about this work, strike me as unwarranted, especially because Boden's practitioner viewpoint brings with it the hindrances such life experience implies. Anyone failing to note Boden's polemical tone is just not awake. Putting it simply, the work is too large to be free of an agenda. However, for that same reason, criticisms of this work from other practitioners appear no less problematic. Cognitive science's reliance on computer simulation means it is not well equipped to give an answer (#CITATION_TAG).","Boden begins by noting that some might mistake ""man as machine"" for an ancient idea.","['She intended it for people whose work includes being active readers, and for them it does represent a useful work of synthesis.']"
239,"Building on the varieties-of-capitalism approach, it is argued that competitive advantage in high-tech industries with radical innovation may be supported by combinations of certain institutional conditions: lax employment protection, weak collective bargaining coverage, extensive university training, little occupational training, and a large stock market. Furthermore, multinational enterprises engage in ""institutional arbitrage"": they allocate their activities so as to benefit from available institutional capital. A high share of university graduates and a large stock market are complementary institutions leading to strong export performance in high-tech. Employment protection is neither conducive nor harmful to export performance in high-tech. A high volume of cross-border mergers and acquisitions, as a form of institutional arbitrage leading to knowledge flows, acts as a functional equivalent to institutions that support knowledge production in the home economy. For example, in contrast with correlational techniques, which attempt to estimate the net effect of an independent variable on an outcome variable, fsQCA attempts to identify the conditions that lead to a given outcome (#CITATION_TAG).",These hypotheses are tested on country-level data for 19 OECD economies in the period 1990 to 2003.,"['We examine how institutional configurations, not single institutions, provide companies with institutional capital.']"
43,"Biological theories of sexual orientation, typically presented in human sexuality classes, are considered by many social psychologists to cause reductions in students' sexual prejudice. Yet when biological theories were not presented to 36 psychology students in a 10-week seminar on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) psychology, both sexual prejudice and two forms of essentialist thinking reduced significantly. Psychological essentialism is an ordinary mode of category representation that has powerful social-psychological consequences. Why and when people engage in this mode of thinking remain open questions. Variability in essentialism across cultures, categories, and contexts suggests that this mode of representing human categories is rooted in a naturalistic theory of category origins, combined with a need to explain differences that cross category boundaries. Although belief in the biological determination of sexual orientation is correlated with tolerance towards lesbians and gay men, beliefs in biological determination are also correlated with prejudice and stereotyping of other minority groups (c.f., Bastian & Haslam, 2006; Keller, 2005; Martin & Parker, 1995; Morton, Postmes, Haslam, & Hornsey, 2009; #CITATION_TAG; Williams & Eberhardt, 2008; Yzerbyt, Rocher, & Schadron, 1997).",,"['This article reviews those consequences, with a focus on the distinctive ways people perceive, evaluate, and interact with members of human categories they essentialize.']"

For example, increased specialization has led to increased surplus of food and made continuing In this chapter, we explore the historical dimension of urbanization and why the ecology of urbanization has, until recently, been missing. Abstract There is growing interest in the ecology of the Maya Forest past, present, and future, as well as in the role of humans in the transformation of this ecosystem. During the Archaic period, a time of stable climatic conditions 8,000-4,000 years ago, we propose that the ancestral Maya established an intimate relationship with an expanding tropical forest, modifying the landscape to meet their subsistence needs. This highly productive and sustainable system of resource management formed the foundation for the development of the Maya civilization, from 3,000 to 1,000 years ago, and was intensified during the latter millennia of a stable climatic regime as population grew and the civilization developed. These strategies of living in the forest evolved into the milpa cycle--the axis of the Maya Forest garden resource management system that created the extraordinary economic value recognized in the Maya Forest today. Remnant urban ecosystems and the rich levels of biodiversity found in the urban Yucatan today are hence viewed to be the products of a millennia-long co-evolution in cultural landscapes (Ford and Emery 2008; #CITATION_TAG).","In particular, we consider the paleoenvironmental data from the Maya Forest area in light of interpretations of the precipitation record from the Cariaco Basin. This new adaptation, we suggest, was based on a resource management strategy that grew out of earlier landscape modification practices.","['In this paper, we bring together and re-evaluate paleoenvironmental, ethnobiological, and archaeological data to reconstruct the related effects of climatic shifts and human adaptations to and alterations of the lowland Maya Forest.', 'We propose that the succeeding period of climatic chaos during the Preclassic period, 4,000-1,750 years ago, provoked the adaptation to settled agrarian life.']"
84,"Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space. Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. At current status of negotiation five forest-related activities have been listed to be implemented as mitigation actions by developing countries, namely: reducing emissions from deforestation (which implies a land-use change) and reducing emissions from forest degradation, conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forest, Enhancement of forest carbon stocks (all relating to carbon stock changes and GHG emissions within managed forest land use). The UNFCCC negotiations and related country submissions on REDD+ have advocated that methodologies and tools become available for estimating emissions and removals from deforestation and forest land management with an acceptable level of certainty.

From 1991-2008, MS prevalence increased by 4.7 % on average per year (p \ 0.001) from 78.8/100,000 (95 % CI 75.7, 82.0) to 179.9/100,000 (95 % CI 176.0, 183.8), the sex prevalence ratio increased from 2.27 to 2.78 (p \ 0.001) and the peak prevalence age range increased from 45-49 to 55-59 years. MS incidence and prevalence in BC are among the highest in the world. Neither the incidence nor the incidence sex ratio increased over time. Background:                  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults worldwide and approximately half of those affected are in Europe. Quality was generally higher in the more recent studies, which also tended to use current diagnostic criteria. Prevalence and incidence estimates tended to be higher in the more recent studies and were higher in the Nordic countries and in northern regions of the British Isles. Few studies examined ethnicity. Epidemiological data at the national level was uncommon and there were marked geographical disparities in available data, with large areas of Europe unrepresented and other regions well-represented in the literature. Both incidence and prevalence were calculated per 100,000 people using the BC mid-year population and were age and sex standardized to the 2001 Canadian population, for consistency to prior Canadian work [10, 11, #CITATION_TAG].","The assessment of differential incidence and prevalence across populations can reveal spatial, temporal and demographic patterns which are important for identifying genetic and environmental factors contributing to MS.

Only peer-reviewed full-text articles published in English or French were included. All abstracts were screened for eligibility and two trained reviewers abstracted the data and graded the quality of each study using a tool specifically designed for this study.",['This study aimed to systematically review European studies of incidence and prevalence of MS and to provide a quantitative assessment of their methodological quality.']
1096,"The 2007-9 period saw an unprecedented crisis emerge in global financial markets with the collapse of several large western financial institutions, and the nearest moment of systemic crisis yet witnessed in the globalised financial system. The crisis has thus provoked a significant questioning of market theories, and in particular understandings of market within orthodox neoclassical economics. Within the social sciences, a significant element of this response has built on a growing heterodox socioeconomic literature which is heavily critical of hegemonic conceptions of the market within economics. However, whilst a small body of work in economic geography has begun to engage with this literature, geographical thinking has not directly sought to conceptualise the nature and significance of market spatiality. Utilising a cultural economy approach, this paper therefore argues that economic geographical theories need to foreground the concept of market rather than treat markets as a 'component' of wider processes. Drawing on the growing heterodox socioeconomic literature on markets, it thus proposes a practice-oriented 'socio-spatial approach' for framing conceptions of market spatiality, arguing that such a spatial epistemology opens up a range of theoretical possibilities for further contesting hegemonic neoclassical theories of the market beyond current socioeconomic critiques. It seeks to illustrate the utility of such a framework through a case study analysis of the limitations inherent in existing policy practices surrounding the early phase of the recent global financial crisis. Leadership turnover is managed by a selectorate - a group of individuals on whom the leader depends to hold onto power. This requires that the selectorate's hold on power is not too dependent on a specific leader being in office. In this view, the epistemological starting point is a recognition that markets 'do not simply fall out of thin air' (#CITATION_TAG Boeckler, 2007, 2009) but rather are phenomenon that are 'continually produced and constructed socially with the help of actors who are interlinked in dense and extensive webs of social relations' (Berndt and Boeckler, 2007: 536).",The paper develops a simple theoretical model of accountability in the absence of regularized elections.

Imaging studies in humans have revealed transient responses in a right-lateralized network in the frontal-parietal cortex (rFPC) around the time of perceptual transitions between interpretations, potentially reflecting the neural initiation of transitions. Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (#CITATION_TAG).","When replay, instead, depicts transitions with the actual durations reported during rivalry, yoked transitions and genuine rivalry transitions elicit equal activity.","['We investigated the role of this activity in male human observers, with specific interest in its relation to the temporal structure of transitions, which can be either instantaneous or prolonged by periods during which observers experience a mix of both perceptual interpretations.']"

1013,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Unreported cases were generally dealt with less carefully than reported cases: a written request for euthanasia was more often absent (87.7% v 17.6% verbal request only; P<0.001), other physicians and caregivers specialised in palliative care were consulted less often (54.6% v 97.5%; 33.0% v 63.9%; P<0.001 for both), the life ending act was more often performed with opioids or sedatives (92.1% v 4.4%; P<0.001), and the drugs were more often administered by a nurse (41.3% v 0.0%; P<0.001).One out of two euthanasia cases is reported to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee. Most non-reporting physicians do not perceive their act as euthanasia. Countries debating legalisation of euthanasia should simultaneously consider developing a policy facilitating the due care and reporting obligations of physicians. In Flanders in 2007, slightly more than half the estimated total number of euthanasia cases (as according to the technical definition of the death certificate studies) were reported (#CITATION_TAG).","Setting Flanders, Belgium.A stratified at random sample was drawn of people who died between 1 June 2007 and 30 November 2007.",['To estimate the rate of reporting of euthanasia cases to the Federal Control and Evaluation Committee and to compare the characteristics of reported and unreported cases of euthanasia.']

Mootha3 1Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA 2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850, USA 3Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA *Correspondence: aravinda@jhmi.edu http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.001 Technologies for genome-wide sequence interrogation have dramatically improved our ability to identify loci associated with complex human disease. However, a chasm remains between correlations and causality that stems, in part, from a limiting theoretical framework derived fromMendelian genetics and an incomplete understanding of disease physiology. It does not take much perspicacity to see that what really makes this difference is not the tall hat and the umbrella, but the wealth and nourishment of which they are evidence, and that a gold watch or membership of a club in Pall Mall might be proved in the same way to have the like sovereign virtues.. George Bernard Shaw, The Doctor's Dilemma (Preface), 1909 Distinguishing correlation from causality is the essence of experimental science. Nowhere is the need for this distinction greater today than in complex disease genetics, where proof that specific genes have causal effects on human disease phenotypes remains an enormous burden and challenge. This is particularly so in this age of routine -omic surveys, which can produce more false-positive than true-positive findings (Kohane et al., 2006). Moreover, genomic mapping and sequencing approaches that are invaluable for producing a list of unbiased candidates are, by themselves, insufficient for implicating specific gene(s) in a disease or biological process. We admit at the outset that the answers are not straightforward, and that there are serious technical and intellectual impediments to demonstrating causality for the common complex disorders of man where multiple interacting genes are involved. Nevertheless, the casual conflation of ''mapped locus'' to ''proven gene'' is a constant source of confusion and obfuscation in biology and medicine that requires remedy. Consider that two types of genomic surveys, one horizontal and the other vertical, are now routine for attempting to understand human biology and disease. In contrast, in vertical or deep surveys, we examine the effects of the genome as the DNA information gets processed, and its encoded functions get executed through its transcriptome, proteome, and effectors such as the metabolome. In turn, this implies that proving a gene's specific role in a biological process, either in wild-type or mutant form, may not be straightforward because its role may only be evident when examined in relation to its eptember 26, 2013 a2013 Elsevier Inc. 21 Box 1. biochemical partners, and in particular contexts of diet, pathogen exposure, etc. This is a particular problem in genetic studies of any outbred nonexperimental organism, such as the human, and studies of human disease, where investigations are observational not experimental. It is the strong belief of contemporary human geneticists that uncovering the genetic underpinnings of any disease, however complex, is the surest unbiased route to understanding its pathophysiology and, thus, enabling its future rational therapies (Brooke et al., 2008). Consequently, for this view to prevail, we should require experimental evidence, be it in cells, tissues, experimental models, or the rare patient, for the role of a specific gene in a disease process. We know that even in a simple model organism, budding yeast, synthetic lethality-- where death or some other phenotype occurs only through the conspiracy of mutations at two different genes--is widely prevalent (Costanzo et al., 2010). Interactions of greater complexity and involving more than two genes are also known in yeast (Hartman et al., 2001) and must be true for humans as well. A human genome will typically harbor 20 genes that are fully inactivated, without 22 Cell 155, September 26, 2013 a2013 Else any overt disease phenotype, presumably due to the buffering by other genes (MacArthur et al., 2012). Acknowledging this complexity, there are two general ways forward. The question then is how ''complex'' are complex traits and diseases? The New Genetics: Understanding the Function of Variation With the rediscovery of Mendel's rules of transmission more than 100 years ago, there was a vicious debate on the relative importance of single-gene versus multifactorial inheritance (Provine, 1971). Geneticists quickly, and successfully, focused on deciphering the specific mechanisms of gene inheritance and understanding the physiology of the gene in lieu of answering why some phenotypes had complex etiology and transmission. Nevertheless, the rare examples of deciphering the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, such as for truncate (wing) in Drosophila (Altenburg and Muller, 1920), clearly emphasized that traits were more than the additive properties of multiple genes. Today, it is quite clear that Mendelian inheritance of traits, including diseases, is the exception not the rule. Nevertheless, the entire language of genetics is in terms of individual genes for individual phenotypes, with one function, rather than the ensemble and emergent properties of genomes. This absence of a specific genetics language for the proper description of the multigenic architecture of traits (the ensemble) remains as an impediment to our understanding of the nature and degree of genetic complexity of the phenotype. The case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating, progressive motor neuron disease, illustrates this point (Ludolph et al., 2012). Despite the lack of evidence, we largely describe ALS as being ''heterogeneous'' and comprised of single-gene mutations that can individually lead to disease. In 1993, mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were identified in an autosomal-dominant form of the disease; subsequently, the disorder has become synonymous with aberrant clearance of free radicals as its central pathology. What is often not appreciated, however, is that fewer than 10% of all cases of ALS are familial and even fewer follow an apparent Mendelian pattern. Even within this subset of cases, more than 20 distinct genes, spanning other pathways including RNA homeostasis, have been identified, and SOD1 represents a minority of cases. The molecular etiology for the majority of the sporadic forms of the disease remains unclear, and the scientific problem in understanding ALS is more than simply identification of additional genes. Are these the key rate-limiting steps to ALS or simply one of several required in concert? Is the aberrant clearance of free radicals the fundamental defect or one of many such pathologies or a common downstream consequence? Given the diversity and number of deleterious, even loss-of-function, genetic variants in all of our genomes (Abecasis et al., 2012; MacArthur et al., 2012) and, in the absence of stronger evidence bearing on these questions, it is fair to assume that ALS patients harbor multiple mutations with a plurality of molecular defects and that free radical metabolism is only one of a set of canonical pathophysiologies that define the disease. No doubt, this plurality is the case for cancer (Vogelstein et al., 2013), Crohn's disease (Jostins et al., 2012), and even rare developmental disorders such as Hirschsprung disease (McCallion et al., 2003). Molecular biology, genetics' twin, on the other hand, appears to have been far more successful in deciphering and describing not only its individual components (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein) but also their mutual relationships (e.g., DNAprotein interaction) and ensembles (e.g., transcriptional complex), although this is also far from complete (Watson et al., 2007). The consequences of the primary and interaction effects are often well understood, even though not completely described, at both the molecular and cellular levels (Alberts et al., 2007). Although the use of genetic tools and genetic perspectives are fundamental to this progress, these advances have not as yet led to a major revision of our understanding of trait or disease variation. The major reason for this discrepancy is that, with few exceptions (Raj et al., 2010), molecular and cell biology has focused on the impact of deleting or overexpressing genes and not grappled with the consequences of allelic variation. Classical Mendelian genetics has been a boon to uncovering biology from yeast to humans whenever a mutation with a simple inheritance pattern can be isolated. This approach has been revolutionary in the unicellular yeast, particularly because genetics (and gene manipulation), biochemistry, and cell biology were melded to understand function at a variety of levels. This kind of multilevel approach has been less straightforward, but still largely successful, for a metazoan such asDrosophilawheremore genes andmultiple specialized cells often rescue the effects of a mutation or enhance its minor effect. Success in this endeavor will require a synthesis of many biological disciplines that includes the role of genetic variation as intrinsic to the biological process, not an aspect to be ignored. Consequently, melding variation-based genetic and molecular biological thinking is of critical importance for both fields and is central to our understanding of mechanisms of trait variation, including interindividual variation in disease risk. If most disease, in most humans, is the consequence of the effects of variation at many genes, then knowledge of their functional relationships, rather than merely their identities, is central to understanding the phenotype. This is clearly a problem of ''Systems Biology'' but one that incorporates genetic variation directly. The ability to integrate the realities of such widespread genetic variation, which are ultimately at the causal root of disease mechanisms, with systems biology approaches to understand functional contingencies is central to the challenge of deciphering complex human disease. Genetic Dissection of Complex Phenotypes Genetic transmission rules imply that, even in an intractable species such as us, one can map genomic segments that must contain a disease or trait gene. Such mapping requires identification of the segregation of common sites of variation across the genome, now easy to identify through sequencing, and recognition of a genomic segment identical-by-descent in affected individuals, both within and between families. This task has become easier and more powerful as sequencing technology has improved to provide a nearly complete catalog of variants above 1% frequency in the population; further improvements to sample rarer variants are ongoing (Abecasis et al., 2012). Consequently, genetic mapping, once the province of rare Mendelian disorders, Cell 155, S is now applicable to any human trait or disease. For most complex traits examined, many such loci have been mapped, but the vast majority of the specific genes remain unidentified. We can sometimes guess at a candidate gene within the locus (Jostins et al., 2012), sometimes implicate a gene by virtue of an abundance of rare variants among affected individuals (Jostins et al., 2012), in rare circumstances, use therapeutic modulation of a pathway to pinpoint the gene (Moon et al., 2004), and sometimes identify one by painstaking experimental dissection (Musunuru et al., 2010), but, generally, identification of the underlying gene has not become easier. In fact, most of the mapped loci underlying complex traits remain unresolved at the gene or mechanistic level. Despite the beginning clues to human disease pathophysiology that complex disease mapping is providing, and the slow identification of individual genes, it appears highly unlikely that we can understand traits and diseases this way. There is indeed evidence for scenarios in which variation in complex traits, including risk of complex disease, is mediated by a myriad of variants of minute effect, spread evenly across the genome (Yang et al., 2011). For Mendelian disorders, gene identification within a locus is made possible by each mutation being necessary and sufficient for the phenotype, being functionally deleterious and rare, and having an inheritance pattern consistent with the phenotype. It's the mutation that eventually reveals the biology and explains the phenotype. Any component locus for a complex disease has no such restriction, as the causal variants are neither necessary nor sufficient, nor coding (in fact, they are frequently noncoding and regulatory) nor rare (Emison et al., 2010; Jostins et al., 2012). Currently, the major attempts to overcome this impediment involve reliance on single severe mutations at the very same component genes and eptember 26, 2013 a2013 Elsevier Inc. 23 Genetic association studies in humans can synergize with prior knowledge and systems-level quantitative analysis to generate predictions of what pathways and modules are disrupted, where (anatomically), and when (developmentally) to yield a specificmorphological or biochemical phenotype. Consequently, these strategies themselves depend on the hidden biology we seek and are applicable only to the most common human diseases. It appears to us that ignorance of biology has become rate limiting for understanding disease pathophysiology, except perhaps for the Mendelian disorders. There are two ways to get out of this vicious cycle (Figure 1). Although we suspect that the numbers of pathways involved are fewer than the numbers of genes involved, this is merely suspicion. Although the genome is linear, its expression and biology are highly nonlinear and hierarchical, being sequestered in specific cells and organelles (Ilsley et al., 2013). Understanding this hierarchy, the province of systems biology, is critical to the solution of the vier Inc. complex inheritance problem (Yosef et al., 2013). One might counter that existing gene ontologies do precisely that, but, even in yeast, this appears to be highly incomplete (Dutkowski et al., 2013). Proving Causality: Molecular Koch's Postulates The evidence that a specific gene is involved in a particular human disease has historically been nonstatistical and based on our experience with identifying mutations in Mendelian diseases. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, all of these rules break down in complex phenotypes where neither cosegregation nor exclusivity to affecteds nor obviously deleterious alleles are likely; moreover, many mutations are suspected to be noncoding and in a diversity of regulatory RNA molecules. Consequently, statistical evidence of enrichment has been the mainstay, but this has two negative consequences: first, scanning across the genome or multiple loci covering tens to hundreds of megabases requires very large sample sizes and very strict levels of significance to guard against themany expected falsepositive findings; second, genetic effects that are small or genes with only a few causal alleles are notoriously difficult to detect, although they may be very important to understanding pathogenesis. This difficulty translates into a low power of detection, as common disease alleles cannot be distinguished from bystander associated alleles, whereas rare alleles are observed too infrequently to provide statistical significance. Consequently, although many genes are ''named'' as being responsible in a complex disease or disease process, proof of their involvement is either absent or circumstantial and not direct. In the late 19th century when bacteria were first shown to cause human disease, they were indiscriminately implicated in all manner of disease with little proof (Brown and Goldstein, 1992). One particularly embarrassing example was alcaptonuria, which Sir Archibald Garrod subsequently showed was inherited and which was his first ''inborn error of metabolism.'' We are likely to repeat this ''witch-hunt'' unless we are careful to note that mapping a locus is not equivalent to identifying the gene, and that identifying a gene and its mutations at a locus depends on numerous untested assumptions (mutational type, mutational frequency in cases and controls, coding or regulatory, cell autonomy). Inmicrobiology, Robert Koch set out three postulates that had to be satisfied to connect a specific bacterium (among the multitudes encountered, not unlike current genome analysis) to a disease: the agent had to be isolated from an affected subject, the agent had to produce disease when transmitted to an animal, and the agent had to be recoverable from an animal's lesion (Falkow, 1988). Simply because we cannot follow Koch to the letter in human patients does not absolve us from the responsibility of demonstrating a rigorous level of proof. This is particularly true if we are to pursue therapeutic targets for these diseases. It is clear that the majority of complex diseases do not harbor this level of proof today; neither do most monogenic disorders. Animal models are attractive because of the ability to do experimental manipulations that test predictions of gene function, but these experiments test the function of a gene in a context that is decidedly different from that with a human patient. However imperfect animal models are, progress in the direction of understanding causality has been very beneficial when gene disruptions alone, perhaps at more than one gene, have taught us fundamental lessons in pathophysiology (Farago et al., 2012). In many cases, investigators have also demonstrated that disease results only when combined with a potent environmental insult. When known, such as the effect of dietary cholesterol vis-a-vis genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in atherosclerosis, such environmental exposures to gene-deficient mouse models have provided a tight circle of proof (Plump et al., 1992). A recent example of gestational hypoxia modulating the effect of Notch signaling and leading to scoliosis in mice and in human families Cell 155, S shows how environmental factors beyond diet can be examined even for congenital disorders (Sparrow et al., 2012). Despite these successes, pursuit of Koch's postulates faces other challenges. For example, mutations in the same gene might not reveal an identical phenotype in humans and in an animal model even if molecular pathways are conserved. This is a particular problem for behavioral phenotypes where brain circuitry may have evolved quite differently in humans and other mammals, challenging our ability to model behavior accurately. Nevertheless, such an analysis might reveal an underlying neural phenotype or a molecular or cellular correlate that is in common and subject to testing of the postulates. Ultimately, a lack of understanding of fundamental physiology is the biggest impediment to our understanding of genetically complex human disease. A unique aspect of genetics research seldom appreciated is that genetic effects are chronic biological exposures and as such can pinpoint the earliest stages of disease not readily studied otherwise. In reality, we still do not fully understand the pathogenesis stemming from some of the earliest identified human disease genes. With better understanding of disease mechanism, it seems likely that many disorders that we think of as ''genetic'' may have ameliorative diet, exercise, or other benign environmental ''treatments.'' Given the potential scientific and medical payoffs of disease gene discovery (Chakravarti, 2001), we argue in this Essay of the need for a rigorous examination of the assumptions under which we connect genes to phenotypes. Below we discuss the nature of the ''proof'' that we desire in order to make fundamental discoveries in human pathophysiology. Success in this difficult task requires us to solve a logical conundrum: how can we understand the genes underlying a phenotype if some of these component factors, in isolation, do not have recognizable phenotypes on their own? Both of these goals are approachable, particularly with recent advances in genome-editing technologies that allow the creation of multiple mutations within a single experimental organism (Wang et al., 2013). The second approach is to focus research on why the disease is complex in the first place. This last aspect is critical: as we argue below, with our current state of knowledge, we are likely to have our greatest success with understanding how genes map onto pathways, and how pathways map onto disease, before a true quantitative understanding of disease biology emerges. The chief criteria have been to demonstrate cosegregation with the phenotype in families, exclusivity of the mutation to affected individuals (rare alleles absent in controls), and the nature of themutation (a plausibly deleterious allele at a conserved site within a protein). We need to move beyond lists of plausible genes, to provide rigorous proof for their role in disease. But this goal is unlikely to be achieved in the absence of a superior understanding of the biology of hierarchical function within genomes, how variation alters these functions, and how these altered functions lead to human disease. There is indeed evidence for scenarios in which variation in complex traits, including risk of complex disease, is mediated by a myriad of variants of minute effect, spread evenly across the genome (#CITATION_TAG).","We estimate and partition genetic variation for height, body mass index (BMI), von Willebrand factor and QT interval (QTi) using 586,898 SNPs genotyped on 11,586 unrelated individuals. We show that the variance explained by each chromosome is proportional to its length, and that SNPs in or near genes explain more variation than SNPs between genes.",['We propose a new approach to estimate variation due to cryptic relatedness and population stratification.']
990,"Lung macrophages are an important defence against respiratory viral infection and recent work has demonstrated that influenza-induced macrophage PDL1 expression in the murine lung leads to rapid modulation of CD8+ T cell responses via the PD1 receptor. Viral infection significantly increased cell surface expression of PDL1 on explant macrophages, lung macrophages and MDM but not explant epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of PDL1 regulation by human macrophages in response to viral infection. Unreported cases were generally dealt with less carefully than reported cases: a written request for euthanasia was more often absent (87.7% v 17.6% verbal request only; P<0.001), other physicians and caregivers specialised in palliative care were consulted less often (54.6% v 97.5%; 33.0% v 63.9%; P<0.001 for both), the life ending act was more often performed with opioids or sedatives (92.1% v 4.4%; P<0.001), and the drugs were more often administered by a nurse (41.3% v 0.0%; P<0.001). Most non-reporting physicians do not perceive their act as euthanasia.

592,"Background: Cancer progression is caused by the sequential accumulation of mutations, but not all orders of accumulation are equally likely. When the fixation of some mutations depends on the presence of previous ones, identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations can lead to the discovery of therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers. Having to filter passengers lead to decreased performance, especially because true restrictions were missed. Evolutionary model and deviations from order restrictions had major, and sometimes counterintuitive, interactions with other factors that affected performance. The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive comparison of the performance of all available methods to identify these restrictions from cross-sectional data. Major efforts to sequence cancer genomes are now occurring throughout the world. Though the emerging data from these studies are illuminating, their reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical observations poses a major challenge. We model tumors as a discrete time branching process that starts with a single driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Two of the models used, called here ""Bozic"" (as it is based on [#CITATION_TAG]) and ""exp"" have no density dependence and lead to exponential growth.","Using the model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor development - providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes and development times that have been observed by epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the model provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations as a function of the total number of mutations in the tumor.","['In the current study, we provide a novel mathematical model that begins to address this challenge.']"

It has been used in clinical and research settings, and translated into numerous European and Asian languages. Hitherto, no study has conducted an analysis to determine the underlying factor structure of the scale. In order to be able to have a relevant, specific and well defined outcome variable to further assess these theoretical explorations, and also to make a meaningful assessment of interventions, a team of plastic surgeons and psychologists created the Derriford Appearance Scale 59 (#CITATION_TAG).","DESIGN Cross-sectional survey designs using clinical (out-patient and in-patient) and general population samples. METHOD Twenty-five items were selected initially from the 59 items of the original DAS59. These were refined to 24 through item analyses and the scale was standardized on 535 patients with a range of problems of appearance and on a representative general population sample (N=1, 107). It is psychometrically robust and discriminates well between patient groups, between clinical and non-clinical populations, and within the general population between those concerned, and those not concerned, about their appearance.","['OBJECTIVES To develop a psychometrically robust and widely applicable short form of the Derriford Appearance Scale, (DAS59), which (1) will reliably and validly assess the distress and difficulties experienced in living with problems of appearance, (2) is acceptable to clinical and non-clinical populations, and (3) facilitates research and clinical decision-making through good standardization and sensitivity.']"
627,"In cognitive archeology, theories of cognition are used to guide interpretation of archeological evidence. But the implications that archeology has for cognitive science particularly relate to traditional proposals from the field involving modular decomposition, symbolic thought and the mediating role of language. There is a need to make a connection with more recent approaches, which more strongly emphasize information, probabilistic reasoning and exploitation of embodiment. Proposals from cognitive archeology, in which evolution of cognition is seen to involve a transition to symbolic thought need to be realigned with theories from cognitive science that no longer give symbolic reasoning a central role. The present paper develops an informational approach, in which the transition is understood to involve cumulative development of information-rich generalizations. Most research in computer vision has been directed towards minimalistic approaches, in which problems are addressed on how properties of the environment can be computed from as little information as possible. Although such approaches may be scientifically well motivated they have only resulted in limited progress towards our understanding of seeing systems. Ballard, Bajcsy and others have pointed out the importance of vision being an active process which is tightly connected to behaviors. Continuous operation over time and early use of three dimensional cues are important in this context. Conceptions of cognition in which symbolic reasoning takes charge are increasingly questioned (Thelen and Smith, 1993; #CITATION_TAG).",We illustrate our proposed approach by some experiments on a real-time active system.,"['We support this thought and also propose that utilizing that the world is rich on information is essential.', 'We develop this idea to show how attention and figure-ground segmentation by an active observer using multiple cues can be separated from analyzing and recognizing what is seen in a consistent way.']"

The treasure lying at the bottom of the world's economic pyramid, attracts companies with unimaginable prospects and profits. The economic pyramid of the world contains more than 400 crores of population at the bottom whose earnings and spendings per capita are low, but as an aggregate, are much larger than they are perceived to be. Hence, it is high time for the corporate managers to make an effort to locate the Alibaba's treasure lying hidden at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP). Broadly, the characteristics and spending patterns of the BOP segment are different as compared to the other segments of the society. In the high and medium range markets, consumers are able to buy bigger packages of consumables such as a 10 kg packet of detergents so that they need not shop frequently. But low-end BOP consumers do not have so much disposable cash to buy in bulk and store. Already in India, 30% of personal care and other consumables such as shampoo, tea, and cold medicines are sold in single serve packages and most single serve packages are priced at one rupee. Hindustan Lever Limited offers Clinic Plus shampoo priced at 50 Paisa. The major differences between the Bottom of the Pyramid and the Top of the Pyramid markets are differences in buying habits and cultural differences. The Bottom of the Pyramid is characterized by a low brand consciousness due to low economic position, and is mostly need driven. Major emerging BOP markets in the world, including China, India, Mexico, Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Indonesia, with a combined population of about 300 crores, represent 70% of the world BOP population. Such a huge jumbo size BOP market promises intense marketing opportunities for the companies. Even with NGOs working tirelessly and government support and international aid being circulated heavily, the problem of poverty still persists. According to the author, the main reason for this situation is that the private sector, which is huge and potentially capable of solving any problem in the world, is practically not involved. The World's Economic Pyramid contains wealthy people at the top with high spending capacities and habits. But the size of this segment is very small i.e., only about 7.5 to 10 crores of 600 crores plus population, whereas more than 400 crores of population live at the bottom of the pyramid earning less than $2 per day and in India alone around 40 crores of people earn less than Rs.

567,"Much bioethical scholarship is concerned with the social, legal and philosophical implications of new and emerging science and medicine, as well as with the processes of research that under-gird these innovations. Science and technology studies (STS), and the related and interpenetrating disciplines of anthropology and sociology, have also explored what novel technoscience might imply for society, and how the social is constitutive of scientific knowledge and technological artefacts. More recently, social scientists have interrogated the emergence of ethical issues: they have documented how particular matters come to be regarded as in some way to do with 'ethics', and how this in turn enjoins particular types of social action. In sum, engagements between STS and bioethics are increasingly important in order to understand and manage the complex dynamics between science, medicine and ethics in society. In this paper, I will discuss some of this and other STS (and STS-inflected) literature and reflect on how it might complement more 'traditional' modes of bioethical enquiry. ABSTRACT Public dialogue about science, technology and medicine is an established part of the activities of a range of charities, private corporations, governmental departments and scientific institutions. However, the extent to which these activities challenge or bridge the lay-expert divide is questionable. Expertise is contested, by the public and the community of scholars who study and/or facilitate public engagement. The colonization of lay positions by expert speakers and the hybrid positioning of lay-experts was characteristic of the consensus and conservatism that emerged. Yet, often an expert-lay divide is perpetuated which closes down opportunities for more reflexive debate [#CITATION_TAG].","We examine participants ' claims to expertise and consider how this relates to their claims to credibility and legitimacy and the way in which these events unfolded. Using a combination of ethnographic and discursive analysis, we found that participants supplemented technical expertise with other expert and lay perspectives. We can also link participants ' claims to expertise to their generally positive appraisal of genetic research and services.","['In this paper, we explore the dynamics of expertise and their implications for the lay-expert divide at a series of public events about the new genetics.']"

Adjacent parcels intermix at rates governed by diffusion time scales based on molecular diffusivities and parcel sizes.

One such constraint that has proven effective is to intermix only parcel pairs that are close, by some criterion, in a metric space defined on the manifold of thermochemical states [26] . In modeling turbulent reactive flows based on the transport equation for the joint probability density function (jpdf) of velocity and composition, the change in fluid composition due to convection and reaction is treated exactly, while molecular mixing has to be modeled. In this model the change in particle composition is determined by particle interactions along the edges of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) constructed in composition space.

1021,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. There is increasing recognition that the development of evidence-informed health policy is not only a technical problem of knowledge exchange or translation, but also a political challenge. This said, the ""translation"" of scientific evidence into health policy is a complex process that is subject to inertia and cultural impediments (#CITATION_TAG).","Yet, while political scientists have long considered the nature of political systems, the role of institutional structures, and the political contestation of policy issues as central to understanding policy decisions, these issues remain largely unexplored by scholars of evidence-informed policy making.We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies that examined the influence of key features of political systems and institutional mechanisms on evidence use, and contextual factors that may contribute to the politicisation of health evidence. Eligible studies were identified through searches of seven health and social sciences databases, websites of relevant organisations, the British Library database, and manual searches of academic journals. Relevant political and institutional aspects affecting the use of health evidence included the level of state centralisation and democratisation, the influence of external donors and organisations, the organisation and function of bureaucracies, and the framing of evidence in relation to social norms and values.","['However, our understanding of such influences remains piecemeal given the limited number of empirical analyses on this subject, the paucity of comparative works, and the limited consideration of political and institutional theory in these studies.This review highlights the need for a more explicit engagement with the political and institutional factors affecting the use of health evidence in decision-making.']"

Although the use of climate scenarios for impact assessment has grown steadily since the 1990s, uptake of such information for adaptation is lagging by nearly a decade in terms of scientific output. Nonetheless, integration of climate risk information in development planning is now a priority for donor agencies because of the need to prepare for climate change impacts across different sectors and countries. Up to this time the human signal, though detectable and growing, will be a relatively small component of climate variability and change. Such methods are commonly applied in IAVanalysis, although multiple criteria are normally applied in determining the final selection of representative climate scenarios to be used (IPCC-TGICA 2007; #CITATION_TAG).","This implies the need for a twin-track approach: on the one hand, vulnerability assessments of social and economic strategies for coping with present climate extremes and variability, and, on the other hand, development of climate forecast tools and scenarios to evaluate sector-specific, incremental changes in risk over the next few decades. This review starts by describing the climate outlook for the next couple of decades and the implications for adaptation assessments. We then review ways in which climate risk information is already being used in adaptation assessments and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of three groups of techniques. We assert that climate change scenarios can meet some, but not all, of the needs of adaptation planning. Even then, the choice of scenario technique must be matched to the intended application, taking into account local constraints of time, resources, human capacity and supporting infrastructure.","['This urgency stems from concerns that progress made against Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) could be threatened by anthropogenic climate change beyond 2015.', 'Although the focus of the review is on information provision and uptake in developing regions, it is clear that many developed countries are facing the same challenges.']"
72,"Health promotion is essential to improve the health status and quality of life of individuals. Promoting mental health at an individual, community and policy level is central to reducing the incidence of mental health problems, including self-harm and suicide. Men may be particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, in part because they are less likely to seek help from healthcare professionals. Although this article discusses mental health promotion and related strategies in general, the focus is on men's mental health. The NHS National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2009) publication - Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem: treatment and management - is a clinical practice guideline for the UK which partially updates and extends the earlier depression management in primary and secondary care guideline (NICE, 2004). There are variations in the suicide rates for different parts of the world, with the highest rates in the Russian Federation, Baltic States, Sri Lanka and Japan, and the lowest rates in Latin America (#CITATION_TAG).","Like other clinical guidelines, it has been systematically developed from the best available research evidence to assist clinicians and patients, and service commissioners and providers in making decisions about the most appropriate treatment and service organisation for this important area of health care need. The National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (one of a number of centres established by NICE for the purpose of clinical guideline development) together with a guideline development group, comprising health and social care professionals, lay and patient representatives, and technical experts, worked on the guidance. The process from initial scope preparation to the production of the final guideline took over two years.",['The aim of this editorial is to bring this important document to the attention of nurses and midwives worldwide who work with depression sufferers']
655,"A few empirically supported principles can account for much of the thematic content of waking thought, including rumination, and dreams. The cues may be external or internal in the person's own mental activity. The responses may take the form of noticing the cues, storing them in memory, having thoughts or dream segments related to them, and/or taking action. Noticing may be conscious or not. Goals may be any desired endpoint of a behavioral sequence, including finding out more about something, i.e., exploring possible goals, such as job possibilities or personal relationships. The article briefly summarizes neurocognitive findings that relate to mind-wandering and evidence regarding adverse effects of mind-wandering on task performance as well as evidence suggesting adaptive functions in regard to creative problem-solving, planning, resisting delay discounting, and memory consolidation. The semantic processing of language and action has been linked to the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP). EEG evidence with eventrelated potentials indicates that infants as young as nine months react with N400 deflections (negative deflections after 400 ms poststimulus) when sequences they observe end unexpectedly (#CITATION_TAG).",The sequential nature of action ensures that an individual can anticipate the conclusion of an observed action via the use of semantic rules. The authors developed an ERP paradigm in which infants and adults observed simple sequences of actions. Adults and infants at 9 months and 7 months were assessed via the same neural mechanisms-the N400 component and analysis of the theta frequency.,['This study suggests that infants at 9 months anticipate goals and use similar cognitive mechanisms to adults in this task.']
138,"NEUROENERGETICS Carbohydrate-biased control of energy metabolism: the darker side of the selfish brain Tanya Zilberter* Infotonic Consultancy, Stockholm, Sweden *Correspondence: zilberter@gmail.com IntroductIon There is evidence that the brain favors consumption of carbohydrates (CHO) rather than fats, this preference resulting in glycolysis-based energy metabolism domination. This metabolic mode, typical for consumers of the ""Western diet"" (Cordain et al., 2005; Seneff et al., 2011), is characterized by over-generation of reactive oxygen species and advanced glycation products both of which are implicated in many of the neurodegenerative diseases (Tessier, 2010; Vicente Miranda and Outeiro, 2010; Auburger and Kurz, 2011). However, it is not CHO but fat that is often held responsible for metabolic pathologies. It is general knowledge that the glucose homeostasis possesses very limited buffering capacities, while energy homeostasis in its fat-controlling part enjoys practically unlimited energy stores. the SelfISh BraIn concept: two meanIngS There are two ways to look at the CHObiasing trait of the brain. (1) The ""Selfish Brain"" is a term coined by Robert L. DuPont in the title of his book where he wrote: ""With respect to aggression, fear, feeding, and sexuality, the brain is selfish. The bad news is, in the long run the body can be harmed as the result. They wrote referring to DuPont's book: ""The brain looks after itself first. Such selfishness is reminiscent of an earlier concept in which the brain's selfishness was addressed with respect to addiction. We chose our title by analogy but applied it in a different context, i.e., the competition for energy resources"" (Peters et al., 2004). These two meaning of the Selfish Brain have important common points if we consider the addiction (highly non-homeostatic) as a result of the ""push"" principle borrowed from the economic ""push-pull"" paradigm of supply chains. As early as in 1998, Hill and Peters wrote: ""According to the 'push' principle, the environment pushes excess amounts of energy into the organism"" (Hill and Peters, 1998). According to DuPond, ""What makes a drug addictive is not that it is 'psychoactive' but that it produces specific brain reward. It is not withdrawal that hooks the addict, it is reward"" (DuPont, 2008). This reward is hard-wired in the brain, in the loci where both ""pull"" and ""push"" systems might be converging, something that is discussed within the Selfish Brain paradigm as the comforting effect of food (Peters et al., 2007), particularly, the CHO-rich foods (Hitze et al., 2010). puSh and pull partS of energy Supply control SyStem The role of depots, as determined by a general principle in economic supply chains, is energy buffering in unstable environments (Fischer et al., 2011). The surplus, naturally, goes into depots. Peters and Langemann, however, remained in doubt about this concept partly due to the fact that this ""push"" does not work invariably for all animal or human subjects (Martin et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2011). Indeed, the sizes of CHO and fat depots are incomparable. Among the most frequently reported consequences of HFD are features typical for metabolic syndrome - increased hunger/appetite, insulin resistance, elevated body fat deposition, and glucose intolerance along with decreased neuronal resistance to damaging conditions. The metabolic state caused by KD (Figure 1C) was called ""unique"" (Kennedy et al., 2007) and it closely resembles effects of calorie restriction (Domouzoglou and MaratosFlier, 2011). the KetogenIc ratIo and the ""puSh"" component of energy metaBolISm The environment in Western-type societies can be characterized as ""pushing"" the energy into our organisms via activation of reward and addiction circuits of our selfish brains. In the standard experimental ""Western Diet"" (5TJN) with KR close to 1:1, CHO proportion is high enough to continuously maintain glycolysis, overconsumption, and the subsequent chain of events resulting in metabolic disturbances detrimental for the brain (Langdon et al., 2011). The NHANES surveys of 1971-2006 (Austin et al., 2011) revealed that in the USA population, the trend toward increased CHO intake and decreased fat intake (KR shift from 0.716 to 0.620) resulted in the increase of obesity But why, then, it is the dietary fat that is blamed for overconsumption, obesity, and neuro-deteriorating effects? the role of macronutrIent compoSItIon Interestingly, the diet categorization (HFD, low-CHO, KD, etc.) A century ago, Woodyatt wrote: ""antiketogenesis is an effect due to certain products which occur in the oxidation of glucose, an interaction between these products on the one hand and one or more of the acetone bodies on the other"" (Woodyatt, 1910). Wilder and Winter (1922) defined the threshold of ketogenesis explaining it from the standpoint of condition where either ketone bodies or glucose can be oxidized. This is a very important point, not only methodologically, but also ideologically. On the other hand, ketogenesis introduces a fuel alternative to glucose, which can be crucial in metabolic pathologies. water-vitamin fast, with body fat as a sole energy source, has been reported (Stewart and Fleming, 1973). non-homeoStatIc effectS of cho verSuS fat From the teleological standpoint, the strong drive for CHO intake beyond homeostatic needs exists very likely due to limited CHOstoring capacities. For fat with its vast depots, there is less (or none at all) evidence for a drive of similar magnitude. Oral stimulation with both sweet and non-sweet CHO activated brain regions associated with reward - insula/frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. In humans, the intra-amniotic injection of fat (Lipiodol) reduced fetal drinking, while injection of sodium saccharin stimulated it; infants consumed the same amounts of milk formulas with different fat contents. CHO-rich food intake (buffet, KR 0.511:1) relieved neuroglycopenic and mood responses to stress independently from oral or i.v. administration of energy (Hitze et al., 2010). Besides, HFD often fails in inducing obesity. Consequently, it is not uncommon in diet-induced obesity experiments that obesity-resistant subjects are eliminated from analysis or CHO are added to the diet to encourage overeating. To sum it up, fat per se is neither as highly rewarding as CHO nor it is as addictive (Wojnicki et al., 2008; Avena et al., 2009; Pickering et al., 2009; Berthoud et al., 2011). Frontiers in Neuroenergetics www.frontiersin.org December 2011 | Volume 3 | Article 8 | 2 obesity; it is CHO that is not limited enough in HFD; (2) KR may be an element of common language in experiments with different methodological approaches.

Lowcarbohydrate diets: what are the potential short- and long-term health implications? However, this is possible only in deterministic environments. In variable environments, energy storage becomes advantageous and approximately equal parts of energy are allocated for maintenance, reproduction, and depots (Fischer et al., 2011). Energy intake beyond rigid homeostatic regulation relies on behaviors with hedonic, rewarding, and addictive nuances more characteristic for CHO than for fat. To maximize energy stores, energy intake relies on CHO-driven behaviors to allow the environmental ""push."" In a recent article entitled ""Using Marketing Muscle to Sell Fat: The Rise of Obesity in the Modern Economy,"" J. Zimmerman wrote: ""In this paradigm, overeating results from more extensive advertising, new product development, increased portion sizes, and other tactics of food marketers that have caused shifts in the underlying demand for total food calories"" (Zimmerman, 2011). On the other hand, the diets with KR of 2:1 or higher are repeatedly described as metabolically beneficial, non-addictive, hunger-reducing, and neuroprotective (Figure 1A).

This leads to cholesterol deficiency in neurons, which significantly impairs their ability to function. Over time, a cascade response leads to impaired glutamate signaling, increased oxidative damage, mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction, increased risk to microbial infection, and, ultimately, apoptosis.

601,"We studied choreographer Wayne McGregor's approach to movement creation through tasking, in which he asks dancers to create movement in response to task instructions that require a great deal of mental imagery and decision making. As part of a programme of research that is developing tools to enhance choreographic practice, an interdisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and dance professionals collaborated on two studies examining the mental representations used to support movement creation. In artists, the higher synchrony in the low-frequency band is possibly due to the involvement of a more advanced long-term visual art memory and to extensive top-down processing. Other studies have focused on the underlying neural mechanisms of creativity in realms other than dance (Jung et al., 2010), especially in music (Limb and Braun, 2008) and drawing (#CITATION_TAG).","To assess the underlying synchronization, which is assumed to be the platform for general cognitive integration between different cortical regions, three measures inspired by nonlinear dynamical system theory were applied as follows: (1) index based on generalized synchronization; (2) index based on mean phase coherence; and (3) index of phase synchrony based on entropy. Strong right hemispheric dominance in terms of synchronization was found in the artists.","['Our primary question was to learn whether mentally composing drawings of their own choice produce different brain electric features in artists and laymen.', 'To this purpose, we studied multichannel electroencephalograph (EEG) signals from two broad groups (all participants were females): artists (professionally trained in visual arts) and non-artists (without any training in art).']"

Learning analytics is an evolving discipline with capability for educational data analysis that could enable better understanding of learning process, and therefore mitigate these challenges. This study reviewed factors that could be used to predict academic performance, but which are currently not systematically measured in tertiary education. It focused on psychometric factors of ability, personality, motivation, and learning strategies. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been proved to be successfully used in a variety of pattern recognition and data mining applications. However, training ANNs on large scale datasets are both data-intensive and computation-intensive. In this paper, we present cNeural, a customized parallel computing platform to accelerate training large scale neural networks with the backpropagation algorithm. Nonetheless, NNs performance has been found to be comparable with other statistical approaches, particularly when approximating complex patterns based on numeric input values (Sargent, 2001; #CITATION_TAG).","Therefore, large scale ANNs are used with reservation for their time-consuming training to get high precision. Unlike many existing parallel neural network training systems working on thousands of training samples, cNeural is designed for fast training large scale datasets with millions of training samples. Secondly, it provides a parallel in-memory computing framework for fast iterative training. Third, we choose a compact, event-driven messaging communication model instead of the heartbeat polling model for instant messaging delivery.","['To achieve this goal, firstly, cNeural adopts HBase for large scale training dataset storage and parallel loading.']"

1190,"According to transaction cost and internalization theories of multinational enterprises, companies make foreign direct investments (FDI) when the combined costs of operations and governance are lower for FDI than for market or contract based options, such as exports and licensing. Yet, ex post governance costs remain a conjectural construct, which has evaded empirical scrutiny, and the lack of focus on the implications of these costs constitutes a challenge for management in multinational companies (MNCs). What effects does the ensuing establishment of subsidiaries abroad have in terms of governance costs? What factors drive these costs? Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Trust begets trust, but for the process to activate it needs to be initiated (#CITATION_TAG).",These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions.,"[""Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming."", 'Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.']"
489,"Understanding how children develop in this complex environment will require a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of how the child and environment interact-- both within and beyond the laboratory. Categories, like children, do not exist in isolation. Consequently, category learning cannot be easily separated from the learning context--nor should it be. According to a systems perspective of cognition and development, categorization emerges as the product of multiple factors combining in time (Thelen and Smith, 1994). To be as inclusive as possible, we consider any case in which a participant responds to how stimuli may be grouped as evidence of category learning. You may notice in these examples that we have not included children's ages because, according to a systems view, research should not be about age per se. Obviously, age must be taken into account in experimental design because age is generally (but not perfectly) correlated with developmental level (e.g., appropriate motor responses differ for a 2-year-old vs. 2-month-old). WHO IS INVOLVED IN LEARNING In the real world children learn through play and independent exploration (HirshPasek et al., 2009). However, in the lab children are seldom alone. This is important because children adjust their learning depending on who is providing information (e.g., the same or different experimenter, Goldenberg and Sandhofer, 2013; human or robot, O'Connell et al., 2009; mom or dad, Pancsofar and VernonFeagans, 2006). Children are also opportunistic and will look for any signal of what the right answer is. For example, children will track who is present when they hear a new word (e.g., Akhtar et al., 1996), whether the speaker has provided reliable information before (e.g., Jaswal and Neely, 2006) and whether a question is repeated (e.g., Samuel and Bryant, 1984). Moreover, who the child is also matters. WHAT IS BEING CATEGORIZED All categories are not created equal: categories vary in complexity and withincategory similarity (Sloutsky, 2010). Where children draw boundaries between categories is influenced by category (object) properties, including distinctive features (Hammer and Diesendruck, 2005), number of common features (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Horst and Twomey, 2013), visual cues to animacy (Jones et al., 1991), the presence of category labels (Sloutsky and Fisher, 2004; Plunkett et al., 2008) and the presence of other objects (e.g., identical or nonidentical exemplars Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007). In naturalistic environments, categories are often ad hoc and flexible (Barsalou, 1983). For example, the category ""toys to pick up before bed"" may be discussed every day, but each day it may include different items. Furthermore, the process of categorizing objects is not independent of the objects themselves: different objects may be more or less flexibly assigned to www.frontiersin.org January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 1 different categories depending on the context (Mareschal and Tan, 2007) and information available (Horst et al., 2009). Where a child lives impacts what social categories they learn and the category choices they make. For example, Black Xhosa children in South Africa prefer own-race faces if they live in a primarily Black township, but prefer higher-status race faces if they live in a racially diverse city (Shutts et al., 2011). In the lab, location matters both in terms of where the child is and where the stimuli are. For example, children are more likely to learn names for non-solid substances if introduced to the gooey items in a familiar highchair context (Perry et al., 2014). For example, yes/no questions lead to a stronger shape bias than forced-choice questions (Samuelson et al., 2009), various types of feedback differentially affect learning categories with highly salient features vs. less salient features (Hammer et al., 2012) and highly variable category members facilitate category name generalization (Perry et al., 2010) whereas less variable category members facilitate category name retention (Twomey et al., 2014). Categorization does not reflect static knowledge; rather, category learning unfolds over time and is a product of nested timescales. Children (and adults) are constantly learning: experimenters' distinction between learning vs. test trials is arbitrary with respect to the processes that operate within the task (McMurray et al., 2012). That is, learning continues even on test trials--in fact, participants may not realize the shift from learning to test trials. Consequently, different behaviors are observed depending on when during the categorization process category learning is assessed (Horst et al., 2005). Category learning is a product of nested timescales including (a) the current moment (e.g., how similar the stimuli are on the current trial, Horst and Twomey, 2013), (b) the ""just previous"" past (e.g., what happens during the intertrial interval, Kovack-Lesh and Oakes, 2007; whether stimuli on the first test trial are novel or familiar, Schoner and Thelen, 2006; and trial order effects Wilkinson et al., 2003; Vlach et al., 2008) and (c) developmental history (e.g., vocabulary level, Ellis and Oakes, 2006; Horst et al., 2009; Perry and Samuelson, 2011). Because children's behavior is never solely the product of a single timescale it is impossible to create an experiment that taps only into category learning in the moment or only knowledge children brought to the lab. For example, Kovack-Lesh et al. UNEXPECTED INFLUENCES If researchers view categorization as static knowledge, then neither the when or how should matter. Many researchers hold this view, which purports experiments are designed to test what a child knows upon arrival at the lab: trial order and trial types are largely trivial. Small variations in what children experience during category learning can have dramatic impact on how they form categories (e.g., sequential vs. simultaneous presentation, Oakes and Ribar, 2005; Lawson, 2014) and differences in testing contexts can lead to indications of what has been learned (Cohen and Marks, 2002). Subtle experimental design decisions, such as the number of test trials to include, may not seem theoretically significant, but they can have profound effects on children's behavior. As dozens of studies illustrate, ""boring"" factors like counterbalancing and stimuli choice during both learning and testing can have a profound effect on findings, including trial order (Wilkinson et al., 2003), how many targets (Axelsson and Horst, 2013) or competitors (Horst et al., 2010) are presented, or the color of the stimuli (Samuelson and Horst, 2007; Samuelson et al., 2007). For example, how broadly participants generalize a category label depends on where the exemplars are presented and if the exemplars are visible simultaneously (Spencer et al., 2011). In particular whether more or less diverse examples occur in the first block of trials influences later generalization (see Spencer et al., 2011, Supplementary Materials). Unexpected influences may not be of immediate theoretical interest to a given experimenter, but they are still often informative--even at times vital-- to the underlying processes at work (e.g., the influence of novelty on children's selection is informative for understanding how prior memory influences current learning). We recognize this can be impractical with populations that are costly to recruit, in which case such factors may Frontiers in Psychology | Cognition January 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 46 | 2 be controlled for statistically, for example with item-level analyses. OUTLOOK Category learning unfolds across both space and time, and small differences at one moment (e.g., shared features among the stimuli; whether exemplars are identical) can create a ripple of effects on real behavior. Behavior emerges from the combination of many factors, including those not explicitly manipulated or controlled by the experimenter. However, just as it is important to acknowledge these unexpected influences, we must not fail to see the forest for the trees. If a behavior such as category learning can only be captured in an ideal environment under carefully-controlled conditions, how much can we generalize to the contexts in which learning typically occurs? Theoretical accounts that neglect the rich influence of context in real time are too narrow to be applied outside the lab (Simmering and Perone, 2013). What we as researchers are ultimately trying to understand is how learning occurs in a real, cluttered world across time and a variety of contexts. Consequently, a solid, theoretically-grounded understanding of cognitive development will require understanding how the child (or adult) and environment interact. In this paper, we include many different types of behaviors under the umbrella term ""categorization."" Our goal is not to create a catalog of milestones; our goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms driving change. Our point, however, is that we will learn more about category learning if we stop asking questions such as ""how do prototype representations compare between 6 and 8 months of age?"" Thus, in order to understand the process of categorization, researchers must ensure that the results they find in the lab are not too closely tied to the specific stimuli. Thus, it is vital to acknowledge the impact of such unexpected influences if we want to understand how categorization unfolds over time. We argue that what infants learn about naming nonsolid substances is contextually bound - most nonsolids that toddlers are familiar with are foods and thus, typically experienced when sitting in a highchair. For example, children are more likely to learn names for non-solid substances if introduced to the gooey items in a familiar highchair context (#CITATION_TAG).","We examine developmental interactions between context, exploration, and word learning.

55,"The evolutionary history of Mexican ichthyofauna has been strongly linked to natural events, and the impact of pre-Hispanic cultures is little known. The live-bearing fish species Allotoca diazi, Allotoca meeki and Allotoca catarinae occur in areas of biological, cultural and economic importance in central Mexico: Patzcuaro basin, Zirahuen basin, and the Cupatitzio River, respectively. The species are closely related genetically and morphologically, and hypotheses have attempted to explain their systematics and biogeography. The separation of A. diazi and A. meeki was dated to 400-7000 years ago, explained by geological and climate events. The isolation of A. catarinae occurred~1900 years ago. No geological events are documented in the area during this period, but the date is contemporary with P'urhepecha culture settlements. # Abstract Molecular clocks have profoundly influenced modern views on the timing of important events in evolutionary history. On the population genetic scale, we review advances in the incorporation of ancestral population processes into the estimation of divergence times between recently separated species. The isolation of A. diazi, A. meeki, and A. catarinae is reflected in the low genetic differences, non-monophyletic patterns, shared haplotypes, and genetic groups assignment, and we considered that the species complex consist in an incomplete lineage sorting pattern [72] [#CITATION_TAG] [74] [75].","On the phylogenetic scale, we address the complexities of DNA sequence evolution as they relate to estimating divergences, focusing on models of nucleotide substitution and problems associated with among-site and among-lineage rate variation. Throughout the review we emphasize new statistical methods and the importance of model testing during the process of divergence time estimation.","['We review recent advances in estimating divergence times from molecular data, emphasizing the continuum between processes at the phylogenetic and population genetic scales.']"
356,"Background Unassisted cessationquitting without pharmacological or professional supportis an enduring phenomenon. Unassisted cessation persists even in nations advanced in tobacco control where cessation assistance such as nicotine replacement therapy, the stop-smoking medications bupropion and varenicline, and behavioural assistance are readily available. We review the qualitative literature on the views and experiences of smokers who quit unassisted. Motivation, although widely reported, had only one clear meaning, that is 'the reason for quitting'. Commitment was equated to seriousness or resoluteness, was perceived as key to successful quitting, and was often used to distinguish earlier failed quit attempts from the final successful quit attempt. Commitment had different dimensions. Ninety-five percent of ex-smokers have quit smoking without professional assistance. Research investigating self-initiated smoking cessation has increased to the point where a sizable data base on this phenomenon is now available. First, we were aware of a small but not unsubstantial body of quantitative evidence on smokers who quit unassisted; [#CITATION_TAG] [49] [50] [51] [52] and second, in the course of our literature search we had identified a considerable number of qualitative studies on smoking cessation.",,"['In this paper we review the research literature that has investigated unaided smoking cessation in order to better understand the quitting process, to identify useful strategies for prospective quitters, and to provide suggestions for professionally based interventions.']"
726,"INTUITIVE AND REFLECTIVE RESPONSES IN PHILOSOPHY by NICK BYRD B.A. IRB protocol #13-0678 Nick Byrd (M.A., Philosophy) INTUITIVE AND REFLECTIVE REASONING IN PHILOSOPHY Committee: Michael Huemer, Robert Rupert, and Michael Tooley Cognitive scientists have revealed systematic errors in human reasoning. There is disagreement about what these errors indicate about human rationality, but one upshot seems clear: human reasoning does not seem to fit traditional views of human rationality. This concern about rationality has made its way through various fields and has recently caught the attention of philosophers. Nonetheless, philosophers are not entirely immune to this systematic error, and their proclivity for this error is statistically related to their responses to a variety of philosophical questions. So, while the evidence herein puts constraints on the worries about the integrity of philosophy, it by no means eliminates these worries. I also owe a great deal to various faculty members in cognitive science and psychology. The concern is that if philosophers are prone to systematic errors in reasoning, then the integrity of philosophy would be threatened. In this paper, I present some of the more famous work in cognitive science that has marshaled this concern. Many philosophers have worried about what philosophy is. Often they have looked for answers by considering what it is that philosophers do. In this article we consider the philosophical temperament, asking an alternative question: What are philosophers like? Recognizing this aspect of the philosophical temperament, it is natural to wonder how philosophers came to be this way: Does philosophical training teach reflectivity or do more reflective people tend to gravitate to philosophy? One of the purposes in considering the various characterizations is to caution the reader from adopting one characterization without considering other possibilities (#CITATION_TAG).",We then illustrate this tendency by considering what we know about the philosophizing of a few prominent philosophers.,"['Given the diversity of topics and methods found in philosophy, however, we propose a different approach.', 'Our answer is that one important aspect of the philosophical temperament is that philosophers are especially reflective: They are less likely than their peers to embrace what seems obvious without questioning it.']"
841,"We consider approaches to explanation within the cognitive sciences that begin with Marr's computational level (e.g., purely Bayesian accounts of cognitive phenomena) or Marr's implementational level (e.g., reductionist accounts of cognitive phenomena based only on neural-level evidence) and argue that each is subject to fundamental limitations which impair their ability to provide adequate explanations of cognitive phenomena. For this reason, it is argued, explanation cannot proceed at either level without tight coupling to the algorithmic and representation level. Even at this level, however, we argue that additional constraints relating to the decomposition of the cognitive system into a set of interacting subfunctions (i.e., a cognitive architecture) are required. Integrated cognitive architectures that permit abstract specification of the functions of components and that make contact with the neural level provide a powerful bridge for linking the algorithmic and representational level to both the computational level and the implementational level. Different types of psychotic symptoms may exist, some being normal variants and some having implications for mental health and functioning. Intermittent, infrequent psychotic experiences were common, but frequent experiences were not. Magical Thinking was only weakly associated with these variables. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas may represent expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder, but Magical Thinking may be a normal personality variant. An alternative approach to solving the reverse inference problem has been developed by Poldrack and colleagues (e.g., #CITATION_TAG; Yarkoni, Poldrack, Nichols, Van Essen, & Wager, 2011).","Method: Eight hundred and seventy-five Year 10 students from 34 schools participated in a cross-sectional survey that measured psychotic-like experiences using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences; depression using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; and psychosocial functioning using the Revised Multidimensional Assessment of Functioning Scale. Factor analysis was conducted to identify any subtypes of psychotic experiences. Bizarre Experiences, Perceptual Abnormalities and Persecutory Ideas were strongly associated with distress, depression and poor functioning.","['Objective: Studies conducted in community samples suggest that psychotic-like experiences are common in the general population, leading to suggestions that they are either variations of normal personality or are different expressions of underlying vulnerability to psychotic disorder.', 'The aim of the present study was to determine if different subtypes of psychotic-like experiences could be identified in a community sample of adolescents and to investigate if particular subtypes were more likely to be associated with psychosocial difficulties, that is, distress, depression and poor functioning, than other subtypes.']"
931,"We present a scheme that produces a strong U(1)-like gauge field on cold atoms confined in a two-dimensional square optical lattice. As in the proposal by Jaksch and Zoller [New Journal of Physics 5, 56 ( 2003 )], laser-assisted tunneling between adjacent sites creates an effective magnetic field. We discuss the observable consequences of the artificial gauge field on non-interacting bosonic and fermionic gases. In this context, g and e denoted two different hyperfine states in the ground state manifold, and the spin-dependent optical potential was obtained by exploiting the vector light-shift arising in a laser field with suitable polarization (see [57, #CITATION_TAG], for example).","Individuals with mild and moderate dysarthria trained and then used 45 command words to input text independently into the PSDD.

1027,"This article analyses domestic and foreign reactions to a 2008 report in the British Medical Journal on the complementary and, as argued, synergistic relationship between palliative care and euthanasia in Belgium. The earliest initiators of palliative care in Belgium in the late 1970s held the view that access to proper palliative care was a precondition for euthanasia to be acceptable and that euthanasia and palliative care could, and should, develop together. Advocates of euthanasia including author Jan Bernheim, independent from but together with British expatriates, were among the founders of what was probably the first palliative care service in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. In what has become known as the Belgian model of integral end-oflife care, euthanasia is an available option, also at the end of a palliative care pathway. This approach became the majority view among the wider Belgian public, palliative care workers, other health professionals, and legislators. The legal regulation of euthanasia in 2002 was preceded and followed by a considerable expansion of palliative care services. The Belgian model of so-called integral end-oflife care is continuing to evolve, with constant scrutiny of practice and improvements to procedures. It still exhibits several imperfections, for which some solutions are being developed. This article analyses this model by way of answers to a series of questions posed by Journal of Bioethical Inquiry consulting editor Michael Ashby to the Belgian authors. Although advance directives may seem useful instruments in decision-making regarding incompetent patients, their validity in cases of dementia has been a much debated subject and little is known about their effectiveness in practice. Insight into the experiences and wishes of people with dementia regarding advance directives is totally lacking in empirical research.Ethics and actual practice are two ""different worlds"" when it comes to approaching advance directives in cases of dementia. It is clear, however, that the use of advance directives in practice remains problematic, above all in cases of advance euthanasia directives, but to a lesser extent also when non-treatment directives are involved. is hotly debated (#CITATION_TAG).",,"[""This paper assesses the contribution of advance directives to decision-making in the care of people with dementia, with a special focus on non-treatment directives and directives for euthanasia.The relevant problems from the ethical debate on advance directives in cases of dementia are summarized and we discuss how these relate to what is known from empirical research on the validity and effectiveness of advance directives in the clinical practice of dementia care.The ethical debate focuses essentially on how to respond to the current wishes of a patient with dementia if these contradict the patient's wishes contained in an advance directive.""]"

From 1991-2008, MS prevalence increased by 4.7 % on average per year (p \ 0.001) from 78.8/100,000 (95 % CI 75.7, 82.0) to 179.9/100,000 (95 % CI 176.0, 183.8), the sex prevalence ratio increased from 2.27 to 2.78 (p \ 0.001) and the peak prevalence age range increased from 45-49 to 55-59 years. MS incidence and prevalence in BC are among the highest in the world. Neither the incidence nor the incidence sex ratio increased over time. Background:                  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults worldwide and approximately half of those affected are in Europe. Quality was generally higher in the more recent studies, which also tended to use current diagnostic criteria. Prevalence and incidence estimates tended to be higher in the more recent studies and were higher in the Nordic countries and in northern regions of the British Isles. Few studies examined ethnicity. Epidemiological data at the national level was uncommon and there were marked geographical disparities in available data, with large areas of Europe unrepresented and other regions well-represented in the literature. It is estimated that more than two million people live with this disease worldwide [1], although the incidence and prevalence vary geographically [2] [#CITATION_TAG] [4].","The assessment of differential incidence and prevalence across populations can reveal spatial, temporal and demographic patterns which are important for identifying genetic and environmental factors contributing to MS. However, study methodologies vary and the quality of the methods can influence the estimates. Methods:                  A comprehensive literature search was performed to obtain all original population-based studies of MS incidence and prevalence in European populations conducted and published between January 1985 and January 2011. Only peer-reviewed full-text articles published in English or French were included. All abstracts were screened for eligibility and two trained reviewers abstracted the data and graded the quality of each study using a tool specifically designed for this study.",['This study aimed to systematically review European studies of incidence and prevalence of MS and to provide a quantitative assessment of their methodological quality.']

This paper explores how people from low-income, minority ethnic groups perceive and experience exclusion from informal science education (ISE) institutions, such as museums and science centers. Drawing on qualitative data from four focus groups, interviews, four accompanied visits to ISE institutions, and field notes, this paper presents an analysis of exclusion from science learning opportunities during visits alongside participants' attitudes, expectations, and conclusions about participation in ISE. In examining the concepts of authoritative language and symbolic power we often look to one legitimate  language placed at the top of a hierarchy that serves to marginalize all others, and in so doing,  marginalizes its speakers. We look at subversive moments of resistance to challenge this structure,  but more often than not, it would seem, this hierarchical structure of language is the one that prevails. The situational context of the dual language system  of Malta provides just such juxtaposition, within which to study authoritative language, symbolic  power, and strategies of condescension, as it is a place where the normal rules of language hierarchy  do not apply. While strategies of condescension  in the use of English abound, there are still ways to negotiate moments of power and meet in the  middle.peer-reviewe Language practices can be understood as forms of capital that delineate the information, culture, and people who are more valued in a particular field (#CITATION_TAG).",,"[""It is important, therefore, to examine language spaces that serve as a counterpoint or a place  where the hierarchy isn't so black and white.""]"

Learning analytics is an evolving discipline with capability for educational data analysis that could enable better understanding of learning process, and therefore mitigate these challenges. This study reviewed factors that could be used to predict academic performance, but which are currently not systematically measured in tertiary education. It focused on psychometric factors of ability, personality, motivation, and learning strategies. Important factors include learning style (e.g., Bruinsma, 2004; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Diseth, 2011; #CITATION_TAG) and self-regulation (e.g., Nasiriyan et al., 2011; Ning & Downing, 2010).","The task involved a collaborative computer-based modeling task.

578,"Much bioethical scholarship is concerned with the social, legal and philosophical implications of new and emerging science and medicine, as well as with the processes of research that under-gird these innovations. Science and technology studies (STS), and the related and interpenetrating disciplines of anthropology and sociology, have also explored what novel technoscience might imply for society, and how the social is constitutive of scientific knowledge and technological artefacts. More recently, social scientists have interrogated the emergence of ethical issues: they have documented how particular matters come to be regarded as in some way to do with 'ethics', and how this in turn enjoins particular types of social action. In sum, engagements between STS and bioethics are increasingly important in order to understand and manage the complex dynamics between science, medicine and ethics in society. In this paper, I will discuss some of this and other STS (and STS-inflected) literature and reflect on how it might complement more 'traditional' modes of bioethical enquiry. Social scientists often lament the fact that philosophically trained ethicists pay limited attention to the insights they generate. Science and technology studies (STS) is one such tradition that is articulating with bioethics, though sometimes fractiously [9, #CITATION_TAG].","Increased awareness of differences in styles of reasoning and objects of research interest might help to overcome the hostility, and an anthropological project is presented as an invitation to a dialogue informed by awareness of such differences.","['This paper presents an overview of tendencies in sociological and anthropological studies of morality, ethics and bioethics, and suggests that a lack in philosophical interest might be related to a tendency among social scientists to employ either a deficit model (social science perspectives accommodate the sense of context that philosophical ethics lacks), a replacement model (social scientists have finally found the ""right way"" of doing ethics), or a dismissal model (ethics should be abandoned all together as a misconstrued veil of power).']"
